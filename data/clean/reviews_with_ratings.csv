"I have rather enjoyed Neil Jordan's films in the past. Things like ""Interview With The Vampire"" and ""In the Company of Wolves"" had a lovely surreal quality that appealed to me.The movie follows the life story of Partick ""Kitty"" Bergen, a young Irishman abandoned by his mother in the 1960s. Growing up, he develops a penchant for dressing up as a woman, and is shockingly open about sex and sexuality, a quality that rankles with his adopted family and the other inhabitants of Irish village he grows up in. He decides to flee the village to and look for his mother...Despite a strong central performance from Cillian Murphy as Kitty, not to mention quality turns from all the supporting cast, for me the movie didn't quite work. I found the long biographical structure of the story unnecessary, and I didn't think we needed to go into that much depth about Kitty's background. It would have been more fun if the film focused on his life as an adult. It would have provided the story with more of a centre and made the long running time much shorter.Furthermore, actors such as Bryan Ferry, Liam Neeson and especially Jordan regular Stephen Rea were woefully underutilised and I would have liked to have seen some more of their characters.A small disappointment from a film-maker I really admire.",negatif
"First let me start off by saying, I had every hope for this film being amazing, seeing as I am hopelessly in love with Cillian Murphy and have NEVER been disappointed in any of his movies. But, come on! The entire plot moved in an aimless, lethargic, trudge that was only enough to keep you from turning it off but not even close to enough to get you to keep from zoning out.I didn't feel depth in a single character, and found them easily forgettable: not the least endearing. It struggled to try and make its theme be ""prufundity in differences"" but ended up with meaningless garbage that wasn't even entertaining. Depite the fact that I gave Cillian every benefit of the doubt, I couldn't for one second believe that the boy was a convincing female. While I'll admit he looked OK, the voice and mannerisms had a decidedly male attitude. Anyway, I just thought it would be nice to have a comment from someone that found everything about this movie boring and trying so hard to be deep that it ends up floundering helplessly in the shallow end of the preverbial pool.",negatif
"I was taken to a midnight showing of the first Lord of the Rings movie. Like having sex for 3 hours with no orgasm I was completely disappointed. The movie was eye candy to behold.  The scenery and the amazing special affects were stunning.  I have not read the books, and frankly, I don't want to now.  I was so bored.  I almost began to cry.  I felt trapped in a movie which went from one foe to the next...to the next....to the next....to the next.....to the next....to the next.....to the next....and on and on and on, so long that when the main character noted ""I wish the ring had never found me,"" I agreed.  As the movie progressed different foes and challenges popped up as though they just magically appeared--Oh look we are stuck in these frigid mountains, no where to go.......it is OH so cold....what do we do? Oh, I know, lets take these mines here that just conveniently randomly appeared!  If you've read the books, you might enjoy the closeness, as I hear it has.  However, if you haven't...don't bother.  It is TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO long...TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO boring....and TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO plotless....and all this, for 3 hours and 10 minutes...and then, then THEN!!!  NOTHING!!!!! Wait until you can set aside 9 hours and watch them all at once, then at least it might be slightly rewarding.",negatif
"Trying to be as objective as possible from the stand-point of one of the ""purist"", my humble question is: Did Mr. Jackson ever read the books? Or more importantly, did Ms. Walsh ever read the books? After all, is it not the responsibility of the true screen writer to condense and translate (while remaining true to the original works) the written word to a format suitable for filming? While no one can deny that the cinematography, graphics, special effects and even the casting (in most cases) deserves the highest praise. It is the loss of the true spirit of the literary work, that irks me most.While I can forgive the omission of many key characters (the films would have been ten times longer), I can not forgive the changes made to what motivated the remaining characters; the blatant changes in events and the placement of characters; the addition of scenes and events that never happened in the book; and of who did what, when and especially why! For the ""purists"" I would not recommend these films, your will be utterly disappointed and dismayed. For those who don't care, or have never read the books -go -you'll have fun -enjoy!",negatif
"Some of us may know the back story of how Tolkien himself never wanted his books to be made into a film and I have to say that I agree with him, much of the magic of his books were in the finer details and these could never be conveyed well in a film. Here we have a film that's well done in some ways yet in the grand scheme of things it was never needed, the books stand alone and this trilogy of movies are a perhaps selfish project? -that are essentially a compromised vision of the books, this big budget 'action' movie would serve those looking for a feast of CGI effects and action sequences, thankfully there is some subtlety and the interplay between characters is the films saving grace and I appreciate the tasteful selection of dialog used for the most part. One of my big beefs with The Two Towers and the other 2 movies is just how nonthreatening Sauron is in these films, I think this aspect weakens the movies a great deal, even the ring wraiths come across as impotent compared to creatures such as the Urak Hai. Another is the abrupt transitions between scenes, and the movies lose much of the 'glue' that the books had tying everything together. Finally 'some' of the CGI effects don't do justice to the imagination - Sauron's eye, and the faces in the dead marsh seem to suffer like Gladrieal did in the previous movie - a little bit too overly dramatic and washed out - I am only mentioning this as a comparison to the majority of effects in this movies which are actually very well done. Also the costumes are excellent, I especially thought the depictions of the orcs were excellent. Overall I can only give this 5 stars.",negatif
"The second part of the movie adaptation of 'The Lord of the Rings' books, this is a good-looking creation albeit not much else. It is a CGI showcase, and features good film editing and make-up, however ultimately it is pretty much on par with the first film in terms of virtues and vices. Again, it is visually stunning, but it still is too long, too violent and it is too convoluted in plot. The screenplay is no improvement over the first film in terms of character and plot development, and therefore it is equally as not involving as the previous part of the trilogy. The film features one of the largest battle scenes of all time, but it is also one of the least interesting, as it is just mindless action. It also is a slow and sluggish watch, and in many ways the weakest entry in the trilogy, however if you can separate the films than this would actually rate as the strongest entry, because the special effects in the film are the best and most creative, and in such a visual but not all so compelling film series, this is one of the most important aspects. The visual and audio effects both won Oscars, and out of the three films it is the only one that deserved Best Visual Effects.",negatif
"Movie is okay. Christian Bale is awesome, Chris still can't act, but we never liked him for his talent, rest of the cast brings what they have to the whole movie is an average Disney factory work, everyone knows their job and they execute is as they should. The story has too many silly jokes. I know Waititi's style, but now he feels like his own parody. Like those Scream parody Scary Movies.",negatif
"Fine seems to cover it, Disney has become fine, everything is fine. It has got to the point where if spending your time aimlessly going through your phone for 2+ hours or watching a marvel movie is a bigger waste of time.",negatif
"Christian Bale is great, Russell Crowe has a good moment, Hemsworth is good but this movie cannot be saved from a terrible script, bad direction and stupid humour that overstays its welcome.",negatif
"I think most people thought it was a big mistake when Disney cut ties with Lord & Miller before they completed their Solo film. Now I'm not so sure. It's a little off-putting having a downright farcical movie in an established cinematic universe. Thor: Love and Thunder is about as grounded as a Naked Gun movie, but for some reason the comedy rarely hits for me, where I can enjoy it in an actual spoof. I was surprised, despite the nearly constant attempts at humor, the crowded theater I was in rarely did more than chuckle. If they're going to make a straight-up comedy then they need it to be more laugh-out-loud funny. Of course comedic taste is extremely subjective, so I'm sure some people enjoy laughing along. I just wish it was as effective as Taika Waititi's other films have been for me (including Thor Ragnarok.)The real problem with Thor: Love and Thunder is that it is so irreverent but they also try to tackle heavier topics. The film starts with the death of a child, it focuses on a major character dealing with cancer, and the villain is literally called ""the god butcher."" Going back to my comparison to The Naked Gun, it's like you are watching that film and the filmmakers expect you to feel bad about Nordberg almost getting killed. There is no weight to anything, and it undercuts any attempt at emotion. I'd be genuinely shocked if someone told me they shed a tear while watching this movie, even if the humor lets up at the big climactic moment, though it clearly is trying for some real heart-tugging. I can take a light-hearted movie in the MCU where nothing of vital importance happens, but there are some important plot points, and that's a problem.That's not the only problem with Thor: Love and Thunder, and I could probably go on a full tirade about many of the other issues. However, I will restrain myself and just hit each one like quick bullet points. The handing off of Mjolnir like a loyal pet kind of undermines the magic of the whole ""worthy"" thing established prior to this film. The quick shuffling off of the Guardians of the Galaxy is about as shoddy as Chris Pratt's hair in the film. The whole god convention sequence is atrocious and makes you feel like Gorr has the right idea. Thor has become as shallow and dumb as the version they featured on the What If show. The handing off of Thor's lightning powers to anyone at any time with any weapon makes him look rather selfish in prior films when they could have used a bit of extra help against someone like Thanos. The deus ex machina of the Eternity wish now makes previous plans of people like Thanos and even the Scarlet Witch feel over-complicated when all they needed was a quick trip with Stormbreaker. I'll stop there, but the really sad thing about all this is that it has taken less than 3 years for the MCU to go from a franchise where I couldn't bear to miss a single film, to a franchise where I might just skip out on some movies because the quality has dipped so dramatically.",negatif
"...Well, maybe not SNL-esque throughout the full length of the movie, but most of the film was a (poorly delivered) ""comedy.""During the first scene, I wondered if I was in the right theater, because it had more of a serious tone than many of the other Marvel movies. Unfortunately, shortly after Gorr encountered his god, the seriousness tone disintegrated immediately and the movie launched into full ludicrous mode.I rolled my eyes too often. The ""jokes"" came zooming by too often. Guns & Roses music was used too often. The goats screamed (way) too often.There's too much that should have been shown, but occurred off screen. (Gorr killing various gods, for example). I often wanted more from the movie and also wanted the movie to end quickly at the same time.At one point, I thought...""I wish I was more tired, so I could take a short nap during this movie."" That's not good.I like Taika Waititi, but he needed to switch to decaf on this project. He turned the knob past 11 to 374, (Take that Spinal Tap).This movie was silly and stupid throughout the majority of its run time. Maybe watch this on TV when nothing else is on.",negatif
"I'm a huge marvel fanboy, and hardly ever have anything bad to say to about the MCU, but this was a huge letdown. Ragnarok is easily one of my top 5 marvel films , so was very excited to see this one, but this was really really bad. It was boring as hell and none of the jokes landed for me. First time in a marvel movie I really wanted to leave or wished it would end already. Huge waste of Gorr the god butcher. And the whole Zeus and Olympus part were so cringe worthy. I don't know how this got made. It was garbage.",negatif
"First off let's start by asking what gods Gorr the GOD BUTCHER actually butchered? Some off screen, one he killed that was far from butchering at the beginning of the movie, apparently cut off Sif's arm but at no point did he seem like this absolutely terrifying villain he should have been. Thor, Valkyrie and Jane never seemed afraid of him in the least. In fact, in the times they were captured they were never hurt, Thor just kept making wise cracks and in the battles Gorr never seemed to have an upper hand other than wounding Valkyrie who was apparently never even close to death. Christian Bale played the character wonderfully but the script was just bad.Now for the humor. There's so much of it that it isn't even humorous anymore. In fact, after the 4th joke in 60 seconds I found myself just going ""can we get on with the movie?"". Many of the jokes fell flat to the point I only heard a handful of people laughing now and then in the movie theater. The ""serious"" moments are interrupted by more joking. Jane telling Thor she has cancer has to be a serious moment right? Cut to Valkyrie and Korg making jokes and singing in the other room. Jane receiving chemo? Nope, ""funny"" moment of her tearing apart her own book to explain wormholes to another guy in the office. The screaming goats were funny the first time they screamed then it just got annoying.Why were the Guardians of the Galaxy in this movie? Starlord looked like a hobo and everyone else was just screaming to the point that it gave me a headache and then of course they brought the goats in.Nobody dies or comes close to dying to a villain in this movie and perhaps that's one of many reasons it wasn't enjoyable. None of the villains have seemed like villains in phase 4. Gorr was redeemed at the end after being beaten. Jane dies of cancer which was expected but then goes to Valhalla in the end credit scene so nothing seems ""final"".Thor steals Zeus' thunderbolt and ends up giving the power of Thor to kids in the movie temporarily...but he whispers it to the Thunderbolt so shouldn't it have been the power of Zeus? This was just one of so many plotholes in this movie. Eternity can grant any wish but uh....why didn't they use that to bring back those erased in the snap or Natasha.The best part of this movie was Thor arguing with Stormbreaker because of him being jealous of Mjolnir. They finally make up after Thor ""gives him a beer"" but then at the end of the movie he gives it to Gorr's resurrected daughter. It's just a small little arc there that went nowhere.Overall this movie was horrible. They tried to take Ragnarok's mix of humor and serious moments but ramped the humor up to 11 and it failed. The end says Thor will return and I hope he does, just with a different script writer and director.",negatif
I can't be bothered typing an essay so I'll sum up:Thor is reduced to a bumbling idiot to elevate Jane and Valkyrie.Horrible CGI.Jokes that don't land.A plot not worth caring about.Forgettable set pieces.Overuse of Guns N Roses.,negatif
"So, carrying on from WandaVision, Wanda continues her arc as a slaver who faces no consequences for enslaving a town full of people to now being a mass-murdering slaver who risks the lives of trillions of people's lives, destroys universes, enslaves more people, so she can murder a child, which will help her switch her plan to murder a mother and kidnap her imaginary children.And her redemption arc is she notices she is a monster and ends her reign of terror in the last 2 minutes.And we're meant to sympathise with her for those heinous acts because she is sad because she had to stop imagining her children, and had to stop all the slaving and torture she was doing in order to imagine some fake imaginary children.It was loud and shiny and stupid, so it was fine as totally brainless, lightweight nonsense... Pretty meh overall, and I stopped paying attention during some parts as I was thinking about other things because it was not engaging at all.",negatif
"Great visuals, actors and actresses do their best to make it believable. Benedict Wong's character proves to be a bad-ass. Olsen also does her best. Cumberbatch is as usual. No bad things there. Even the cameos can, at some level, sell the plot points.OK!There is one important plot hole: at the end of WandaVision, Wanda learns hot to neutralize other people's magic. She does that at the magnitude of a town. In this movie, instead of using that same magic and by-pass the Sorcerer Supremes and their wizards, she tortures and kills them. Why?One important issue in character development: Wanda learns that her happiness means nothing if it is based on other people's misery at the end of WnadaVision. In this film, she has completely forgotten that lesson and at the end she learns it, again! Come on! Writers! Learn to respect these characters!Disney identity politics: Wanda kills the 3 male cameos (Picard, Jim from the Office, and some guy) easily. Literally, with her mind. OK. But she fights Carter and Captain Marvel, and Captain Marvel dies because of a statue falling on her! The same Captain Marvel, who pierced a hole in Thanos's spaceship, dies because of rubble?!And of course, she does not look for a universe where Vision is still alive.If you have noticed, I did not mention Dr. Strange. It is because Dr. Strange has NO function or importance in this movie. Cut out his scenes completely, and the plot will not change.In a Dr. Strange movie, Dr. Strange does not matter, at all.Edit: other than the VFX scenes, the worst photography and the worst editing in MCU.",negatif
"I always had some issues with MCU films but now they aren't even entertaining? Oh Raimi, what a disappointment. I honestly only liked the horror elements and being able to see some blood in a MCU film. Nothing else.The plot is super weak - the worst of the film - but the script is also very erroneous with some strange and unexplainable writing decisions. There are some interesting shots - some Dutch angles and POV are cool - but this feel stupidly long for a film that is just 2 hours long. It's like watching the action going from setpiece to setpiece in a very inorganic way while travelling between boring universe with a lot of cringe dialogue. I don't even get the point of all this story for the entire universe and even the score - surprisingly considering that is Elfman - is super generic.I won't lie: I had much more fun watching Eternals, Captain Marvel or Wonder Woman 1984 than this one. Said it.",negatif
"After months of hype, we are left with a mess of a story that is mostly just CGI blobs, some light shows and some boring dialogue. I loved the first Strange movie, it's my second favorite after Captain America Winter Soldier. So this was extra disappointing.Firstly, you're not going to have any idea what's going on with the main antagonist unless you watched the Disney+ show Wandavision. Even though I did watch it, it had been months, and I didn't remember all the details, so her whole backstory fell flat. This movie was less about Strange and more about her.There's also a subplot involving Strange's old flame, but since we only saw them as exes in the previous film, it Didn't really feel that impactful.There's also an obligatory teen sidekick, which I guess is now standard in the Phase IV fully Disneyized MCU. She might have been interesting, but she's just there as a macguffiin and has no real personality.There's also random cameos from other Marvel properties, I'm beginning to see these bits of crossover fan service are the sole purpose of having a multiverse.Seriously, I don't know why I keep giving my money to this franchise. Black Widow, Eternals, Shang Chi and now Dr Strange 2, have all been dull, uninspired CGI crap fests, that rely entirely on cameos and fan service to keep people coming back. Let's just face it, Hollywood milked all they could from Marvel. It's time to give the franchise ( and maybe all superhero movies)a good 10-15 year rest and reboot it after audiences grow nostalgic.",negatif
"This film is about a transvestite on one level, but it is also a lot more: it's about, belonging, being, loving and being loved. What could have been a one-dimensional caricature becomes a three dimensional movie in the hands of a good director like Neil Jordan, and actors such as Liam Neeson, Stephen Rea, and Cillian Murphy (who is magnificent).Cillian Murphy imbues Patrick ""Kitten"" with growing dignity as he/she matures through the film, and at the end she has become a self-assured woman, who has 'found' family, her mother and father, and a meaning in life.The film does not shy away from the Irish-English conflict, either, and the prejudice directed against ""Paddy"" is appalling, reminiscent of ""In the Name of the Father."" It is not for the faint-hearted, be aware! Costumes and music of the late 60's / early 70's are both equally impressive. There is an excellent soundtrack.In all, I found the film quirky and uplifting; a friend with me pronounced it ""depressing"". Whatever, it needs to be seen and Provo's an interesting view of the times in which the story is set. Judge for ourself.",positif
"Neil Jordan's films are always a pleasure to watch. There are always surprises in the way he develops his movies, as he proves with ""Breakfast on Pluto"", which the director helped adapt for the screen with the author of the novel, Pat McCabe. Mr. Jordan achieves another triumph in his distinguished career with this new movie that has a genuine and gritty look thanks to the excellent cinematography by Declan Quinn.When young Patrick is left at the step of the small town's church, Father Bernard doesn't seem too surprised to find the young infant at his door. He is instrumental in placing the young boy with one of the town's women who brings up Patrick until he is a teen ager. It becomes clear young Patrick is a little girl trapped in a boy's body. He begins calling himself Kitten. His love for the outrageous makes him dress in a manner that he sticks out from the crowd. As such, he attracts the eye of a singer of a band who falls for Kitten and takes her to live in a remote part of the country. Alas, the romance takes a tragic turn because of Billy's involvement with the IRA.Kitten always wanted to find the ""Phantom Lady"", a nickname he gave to his natural mother, who moved to London after giving him up. As he arrives in the big city, Kitten discovers a world he never knew and in many ways, he thrives int the rich atmosphere of that swinging place at that time. The film is, in a way, a picaresque account of Kitten's road to maturity. His goal to find his mother doesn't happen until the end of the film. When the moment comes, Kitten is not resentful of the way he was left behind as he discovers that his mother has made a life for herself and her new reality.The film is a delight because the work of Cillian Murphy. Mr. Murphy makes the delightful Kitten come alive. This is a tricky part to play and with the guidance of Mr. Jordan, this young actor makes the most of it. Equally excellent in smaller parts are Liam Neeson, Stephen Rea, Brendan Gleeson, Ruth Negg and Gavin Friday.The brilliant collaboration between Mr. Murphy, the star, and Mr. Jordan, the director, pays off in many ways making this film the delight and fun it is to watch.",positif
"I saw the film at the NY Film Festival (with the actors in attendance), and I have to say that I loved it. In the film, Patrick ""Kitten"" Braden is an Irish baby who was abandoned by his mother on the doorstep of an uncaring stepmother. From the time he is a child, Kitten's cross dressing tendencies and his outspoken nature cause people to reject him (remember, this is Catholic Ireland in the 70s). Kitten grows up among the unrest of the IRA, but he is determined to be happy, and in order to be happy, he has to be himself (or herself). He goes to London, where he encounters all sorts of problems (they don't like the fact that he's Irish or a transvestite), but he keeps his optimistic nature despite all the hardship. The film is not about a person discovering himself (as so many coming-of-age movies are); it is about a Kitten knowing who she is and not changing her ways to please the world at large.The direction and cinematography are amazing, but then this is Neil Jordan. Whatever problems you might have had with Interview With a Vampire, you can't deny that the movie was beautiful to look at. The same is true of all Jordan's films. He starts this film with a bird's eye view, and has many beautiful touches throughout. The chapter titles are hilarious. In particular, look out for the beautiful shot composition and direction of the scene between Kitten and her father in the peeping club. It's absolutely beautiful and well shot. Though he strays from the book (a lot), I believe the movie remains true to the character of Patrick, a charming, sometimes self-involved person who stubbornly makes his way through life. It must have been difficult to bring Kitten's active fantasy life to the screen, but Jordan helps us navigate between her fantasies and her reality with great skill.The performances are the best thing about the film. Liam Neeson is always great, and this is no exception. Same goes for Stephen Rea. The actress who plays Charlie is someone to watch out for; she's great. The guy who plays Irwin did not impress me, but he wasn't bad. The movie, however, belongs to Cillian. Physically, he is suited for the role because he's so small, but it isn't just his appearance that helps. I've been watching Murphy's career since 28 Days Later, and I love his ability to switch between being really intimidating (Red Eye) or really vulnerable (How Harry Became a Tree); sometimes he's both in the same movie (28 Days Later). The man knows how to use his body to convey strength, or the lack thereof. Here, he is absolutely convincing as the witty Kitten, who desperately wants to be loved, but won't compromise her personality. You can see the hurt in his eyes when he is mistreated, but also the strength of his mind when he is determined to do something (witness the gun disposal scene and the police interrogation scene). Just because Kitten looks weak doesn't mean he is weak. When you least expect it, he summons a great amount of strength to pull through difficult situations.I highly recommend the movie to anyone who has a chance to see it. It is hilarious, yet heartbreaking. The events related by Kitten are sad and terrible, but Kitten's sense of humor always shines through. The audience was in stitches the whole time. Was the movie perfect? No. Is it incredibly good, even great? Definitely.",positif
"Based on the novel by Pat McCabe, ""Breakfast on Pluto"" takes us on a loopy journey through the turbulent years of the late 1960's and early 1970's. Our guide for the occasion is one Patrick ""Kitten"" Jordan, a hopelessly romantic transvestite who finds himself looking for love in all the wrong places.The story begins in 1956 Ireland, when Patrick, as an infant, is left on the doorstep of a local priest who may just possibly be the father of the child. As Patrick grows up in the care of a bitter foster mother, he comes to learn that his real mother was a beautiful young woman - a dead ringer, he's told, for Mitzi Gaynor - who worked as a housekeeper for the priest, then disappeared in London not long after Patrick was born. With his effeminate mannerisms and penchant for wearing women's clothing, Patrick does not exactly fit into the highly conformist world of Irish Catholic society, and, as a result, he suffers much abuse at the hands of his less-than-understanding parochial school teachers who have no idea what to make of him. But Patrick has unlocked the secret to survival. He simply gives back as good as he gets, using sardonic humor and an air of indifference to protect himself from the ugliness and harshness of the society around him. Even if he is only laughing to cover up the hurt, at least it beats crying his eyes out at every bump in the road life throws his way.Eventually, Patrick becomes old enough to leave home and make his own way in the world. The film relates his brief involvements with a rock-n-roll band, some IRA gun runners, and an exploitative magician, as well as his eventual journey to London to find the mother who abandoned him. While there, he has a brief stint as a streetwalker and is even arrested as the prime suspect in a dancehall firebombing. But all of these travails are just brief downpours in Patrick's life experience, and while they may dampen his mood at times, they can't extinguish his spirit.Writer/director Neil Jordan has turned McCabe's novel into a fast paced (if overlong) film filled with warmth, humor and a sort of cockeyed optimism that helps to counterbalance some of the grim social issues (prejudice, child abandonment, terrorism) that lie along the story's periphery. The film occasionally feels aimless and episodic and some of Patrick's experiences are more compelling than others. Most of the subsidiary characters are left sketchy and underdeveloped, but that really doesn't matter all that much because Patrick has enough personality for the lot of them. And Cillian Murphy makes what could easily have been just another mincing gay stereotype into a multi-dimensional character of substance and depth. Most of the other actors (Liam Neeson, Stephen Rea et. al.) aren't given enough screen time to make much of an impression, though Neeson nicely underplays the role of Patrick's priest and father.Patrick knows that, when the going gets tough, we all need to journey to that special place of imagination and beauty where we can find security and comfort. For Patrick, as the title suggests, that place is Pluto. However, now that that particular celestial object has lost its planetary status, I wonder if Patrick will still be traveling there to partake in the most important meal of the day.",positif
"While this is not a completely conventional film either in structure or storytelling, it is deeply committed to telling the story of Kitten. Just as the film is committed, so is Cillian Murphy committed to being the best Kitten he can, and he succeeds to an almost uncomfortable point, which I think is part of the storytellers goal.Who does not want to be loved? Not many of us, and Kitten wants it more than most. Her journey to find love in whatever form it may take is both touching and harrowing at times. You cringe when she finds her self in certain situations, and you root for her to take charge of her life, but that is something she is quite unable to do for the most part of her journey.While this story features the good, the bad and the ugly of the transvestite lifestyle, there is no judgment being made, it is presented as a simple fact of Kitten's life from nearly the first time you see her. That in itself is refreshing. There are stereotypes, but not presented in stereotypical situation, which is also refreshing.I came away from this movie with a warm feeling in my heart for the character, the story, and the commitment of everyone involved in the film, it drew me in, it took me to places I did not expect, and it gave me a film experience you simply can not find every day in our cookie cutter Hollywood film world these days. My hat is off to all of you involved in the film. If you like something different, something unexpected, and something unusual made with a lot of love, this is the film for you.",positif
"Cillian Murphy (""Batman Begins,"" ""Red Eye"")gives a marvelous performance as Patrick ""Kitten"" Brady, a flashy transvestite who came of age in Ireland and Great Britain during the English government's battle with the Irish Republican Army in the 1970s.Told in chapters, such as ""When I was Out of My League,"" or ""It's Tearing Me Apart,"" or ""Phantom Ladies,"" there is not really a lot to recommend here except for Murphy's brilliant reading (one which may even cop him an Oscar nomination, but I doubt it) and a great soundtrack that plays everything from the Shadows to Bobby Goldsboro to Silver Convention to the Youngbloods, among others.Abandoned as a baby in his small Irish hometown and aware from a very early age that he is different, Braden is an endearing, deceptively tough young man. He dresses in his foster sister's clothes and applies her lipstick, only to scandalize his cluck-clucking foster mother. In his teens, he gets into even more trouble with his Catholic school priests after writing a hard-core story of his birth (claiming that one of the parish fathers, Liam Neesom, is really his dad).Taking a powder to London, he falls into the transvestite glam rock scene, taking small time show business jobs such as a costume-wearing Wombie with Brendan Gleeson (""Braveheart,"" ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire""), and a cheap suit magician's assistant with Stephen Rea (""The Crying Game,"" which was also about the IRA and transvestism). All the time he is searching for his real mother, the only clue to her identity is that she looks like Mitzi Gaynor.His best friends Charlie and Irwin have a relationship, she gets pregnant, he gets killed by the IRA, he is implicated in the bombing of a British discotheque, falls into prostitution, peep shows and finally settles into sort of an ordinary life helping to raise Charlie's baby.Directed by Neil Jordan (""The Good Thief,"" ""The Crying Game""), this is an interesting picture carried - once again - by Murphy and the music and is based on the novel by Pat McCabe (""The Butcher Boy""). Also look for an interesting cameo by Brian Ferry as a homicidal maniac.",positif
"There's never been a character like ""Kitten"" on the screen before or an actor like Cillian Murphy for that matter. What a feast of a film! What a joyful race through a desolate existence dressed in smiles and hope and gratefulness. Neil Jordan's introduce us to this extraordinary real life character with the magical slant of a fairy tale. A lesson for all seasons. A unique portrait of a victim that behaves like a hero. The idea of victim doesn't even enter the orbit of his reality. How beautiful! I hope this marvellous film find its way to a large audience. I want everyone to feel what I felt. I was enthralled by the positiveness at the heart of its message. And if all this wasn't enough. Liam Neeson! Giving the best performance of his career as the most human of the imperfect humans that populate the planet. Do yourself a favour, put aside preconceptions and run to have breakfast on Pluto.",positif
"I found this movie one morning on cable. I couldn't stop watching it.Cillian Murphy is mesmerizing. His performance makes you want to watch this movie. He deserved to win the Golden Globe in 2006 for his performance.The only negative is you must listen hard to understand the text of the movie as the accents and language are thick and difficult to understand at times.Liam Neeson is also outstanding in this movie as well. Without giving anything away, he has one scene where he goes to Kitten in London and explains things. I cried! It is definitely worth watching.",positif
"Cillian Murphy is superb as an alien of sorts finding its way in our midst. Giving the other cheek as if it was nothing. The goodness, Cillian Murphy, finds in his character goes - I'm sure - far beyond what the screenplay may have required. The goodness of his character feels private. A personal discovery. I hope I'm not making the character sound sentimental, because he/she's not, far from it and that is one of the many surprises to be enjoyed in a film full of surprises. Neil Jordan had already confronted sexual identity in the brilliant ""The Crying Game"" he, as far as I'm concerned, goes even further in ""Breakfast On Pluto"". There is no confusion here, everything is blatantly true. Moving beyond words. A mesmerizing piece of acting and film making of the purest kind. Don't miss it.",positif
"I really liked the opening and closing sequences of this film, including the robin dialogue  it added a nice whimsy and set the tone for the film. But at 2 hours and 15 minutes, there was a lot of tedium in between. The story had little coherence and never really engaged me. It just kind of chugged along from one chapter to another. I didn't have a problem with Cillian Murphy's character  it had more to do with the writing of the story.The revelation by the priest seemed to be straight out of Wim Wenders' Paris, Texas. I generally like Jordan's film, but I didn't find much to like about this one. Others may may find it more entertaining.",positif
"This spellbinding, tightly written, tightly wound, full speed ahead film is Neil Jordan's best work by far since his 1992 hit, ""The Crying Game."" And, interestingly, in this new film, Jordan returns to exactly the same intertwined themes that marked ""Crying Game"": the armed struggle of Northern Irish Catholics against the British Crown and gender bending.Unlike the last minute revelations in ""Crying Game,"" however, here the protagonist's transsexuality is placed front and center from the getgo. Cillian Murphy gives a bravura performance as Patrick ""Kitten"" Braden, in a story set in the 60s and 70s. Murphy oozes sensual vitality and is a world class flirt, but he's also genuinely kind and compassionate toward everybody.The story is divided into 35 brief, fast paced ""chapters"" following Kitten's life over several years, first in a village near Belfast, later in London. The musical score, which is extraordinarily good, is an eclectic mix of everything from 40s pop tunes to Harry Nilsson and Van Morrison. Good supporting turns are provided by Liam Neeson, Ruth Negga, Stephen Rea, Gavin Friday and Brendan Gleeson. My top rated narrative drama of 2005: grade 10/10 A.",positif
"Shown at the New York Film Festival, October 2005. Limited US release November and December 2005.Neil Jordan and Patrick McCabe have collaborated in adapting McCabe's 1992 novel recounting the multi-faceted adventures of a transvestite from a little Irish town near the northern border who grows up in the Sixties and Seventies. This unusual and chronically upbeat person is Patrick/Patricia ""Kitten"" Braden (Cillian Murphy), who goes to London in his twenties to find his birth mother  ""The Phantom Lady,"" he calls her  who abandoned him as a baby on the doorsteps of a parish priest (Father Bernard, Liam Neeson). ""Pluto"" is a whirl of theatrical experiences  including stints as a rocker's ""squaw"" and a magician's assistant, not to mention street-walking and political violence which Kitten tries  not altogether successfully  to escape to live a fairytale life like the one described in Bobby Goldsboro's saccharine ""Honey"" and a lot of other bad pop songs that provide the movie's soundtrack. The story's divided into dozens of jaunty little chapters. Kitten/Patricia's fairy tale is really anything but pretty, but it's colorful and intentionally amusing and shows both Jordan and the unusual and strangely watchable Murphy working at an extremely manic pitch. This NYFF ""centerpiece"" has a kind of epic squalor. One must admire the smooth wheels of its giddy storytelling, but the talent of the young man with the pretty face, big cheekbones, and hauntingly big pale blue eyes is somewhat misused. He nails the resilient sweetness of his character a little too early and then tries to hog the screen with a one-note performance for over two hours. Lots of other good actors, including Stephen Rea, Brendan Gleeson, Liam Neeson, Gavin Friday, Ian Hart and Bryan Perry, keep him from succeeding completely in that aim, but the movie isn't up to Jordan's best work, such as ""Mona Lisa"" and ""The Crying Game."" I'd rather watch it than ""Interview with a Vampire,"" though, and it's another big notch on Cillian Murphy's ladder to fame.",positif
"With ""Breakfast on Pluto,"" Neil Jordan attempts a whimsical picaresque tale but creates instead a pale and glaringly underdeveloped movie.Cillian Murphy tries with all of his might to inject some vitality into the character of Patrick Braden, an effeminate boy who grows up to be a cross-dressing gamine, a sort of modern-day Scarlett O'Hara who wants to prance through life without getting his feet dirty in any of the world's messiness. Instead of the Civil War, the backdrop here is 1970s Ireland and the constant threat of violence posed by the IRA. Patrick leaves his home to search for his mother, who abandoned him when he was a babe, and inadvertently finds himself mixed up with the terrorist group. From there he flees to London and has all sorts of what we're supposed to think are nutty adventures, until a happy ending finds Patrick at peace and all right with the world.None of this really works. Neil Jordan, a filmmaker whose repertoire suggests political preoccupations, does not seem at any moment convinced by the fantasy or optimism of his own film, so everything rings false. Nothing that happens to Patrick, good or bad, seems to have any significant consequences, and we don't ever really learn much about him or about what he himself has learned on his journey. I believe Jordan intends for us to believe that Patrick has grown as a person over the course of the film, but I only believe that because of the conventions of picaresque stories, not because I saw any growth in Patrick's character. The screenplay works double time to race through all of the plot points -- it feels as if the screenwriter were adapting an 800-page novel to the screen but didn't want to leave anything out. The story introduces a character in one scene only to send him packing two scenes later without having made any tangible impact on the story.""Breakfast on Pluto"" is not a bad movie, and despite its flaws still offers a moderately enjoyable ride. The awesome pulsing soundtrack helps greatly, and often does much of the work that should have fallen to either Jordan or his actors. I found myself at times responding to nothing but the music, which does not make for a whole-hearted recommendation of the film, but I'll take what I can get.Grade: B-",positif
"This film is fabulous- and has nothing to do with the solar system (haha!) Cillian Murphy is AMAZING in his complicated role as a trans-sexual man growing up in Ireland in the 1970's and his quest to find what he wants in his life. (Do not judge Mr. Murphy's acting skills from just watching Batman Begins or Red Eye this level of acting falls more in the type of his earlier works such as On the Edge and Disco Pigs) Liam Neeson, Stephen Rea, and Brandon Gleeson are far more than excellent in supporting roles. This film is dependent on its star (Mr. Murphy) and he shines. The themes in this film are universal. Even while the story is sad and the situation the main character- Kitten-finds herself in are very sad, it somehow always becomes funny. The interaction between Kitten and the people around her is fascinating, funny and true-to-life. Mr. Murphy is amazing and deserves and Academy Award for his stunning and flawless portrayal of such a complicated character. It is fabulous!!! Don't want to spoil anything about the plot but if anyone has read the book DO NOT expect the same situations or ending.This film is tender, sweet, funny, has an amazing script and has actors that made this (to some) far-fetched (not to me or anyone I know but one could have that impression) fairy-tale like story excellent. If you strip away the complicated details of this trans-sexual Irish male and his travels during the 70's you can find the root, universal story of a young person looking for love.",positif
"Hilariously provocative, politic, Irish indeed, Breakfast on Pluto is an entertaining movie that gets you on tears sometimes. I find the main character somehow weak, too easily strayed from his unknown path, and even though his performance is top-class, I kinda longed for a moment of assertiveness until the time came when he was facing his long-lost mother and he decides to hide his identity. Good ending, realistic, believable with mother and son crossing their paths like the strangers they are. Liam Neeson fills the screen and not because we know him but (I guess this is great for a director) because he expresses the right emotions at the right time perfectly. There's no doubt about what he's going through when he utters his lines. Fantastic the camera work, those aerial shots at the beginning creating a vertigo that lets you down afterwards. I mean that it is the life of someone quite attached to the very basic stuff of life: body issue's, love longing and he never gets off this perspective, looking for any strand of love he can get. Even in the wrong places.",positif
"A masterpiece. I have not seen many of Jordan's other works, but I intend to give his career a thorough examining after seeing Breakfast on Pluto. I also now have an immense respect for Cillian Murphy. To go from 28 Days Later and Red Eye to the layered, mesmerizing performance of Pluto is astounding. The story of using fantasy to escape the harshness of reality is so appealing, one would think this movie could be accepted by the masses. Dreamy visuals, multi layered and realistic characters mixed with stark visceral violence and political mechanisms create an emotionally jarring experience unlike anything I have ever experienced before. I intend to go to the film again and perhaps again. And I urge everyone to go and see this film and support it. Instantly in my top ten all time favorite movies. Bravo Mr. Jordan and Bravo Mr. Murphy.",positif
"Cillian Murphy gives a brilliant and compelling performance as Patrick into Kitten, but I wish that I could have liked his character more and had more empathy with ""his/her"" journey in the film.The music and the costumes take you back to those ""glam rock"" days of VELVET GOLDMINE with Murphy sashaying through scenes with various men that leads to London. Stephen Rea gives a marvelous performance as a Magician with his own issues to bear,let alone keep Murphy with him for very long. The scene in the London disco with the handsome English soldier who appears to accept Kitten for what she is, and then what transpires afterward, is haunting.Act Three is really the best in the film when Kitten returns to help her best friend and finally makes the journey to move forward from her past. Kitten's final scene as she pushes the baby carriage with her best friend and gazes back at her mother and her son is one to remember.",positif
"I lived in London in 1973, the year that the main character in the film arrives in London from Ireland.Breakfast On Pluto caught the tone of London in 1973 so well that it was like re-living the past. A past when friendships were mighty and strong; a past when London was a sexually liberated city; a past when people were so wrapped up in television that the London park system had to hire people to dress up like the television creatures called wombles.But more than bringing 1973 back to life for me, this film showed me an amazingly resilient Irishman named Kitten. To the people who think that a 135-minute film is way too long, I would tell them to go see Breakfast On Pluto, because those 135 minutes just fly by. And they are 135 minutes of great acting, across the board.",positif
"Breakfast on Pluto (2005), written and directed by Neil Jordan, is the story of Patrick ""Kitten"" Brady (Cillian Murphy), a young man growing up and trying to survive in Ireland in the 1960's and '70's. The fact that Kitten is naive, gay, and a transvestite doesn't make life easy for him.It's hard to know what to make of this movie-- Kitten never harms anyone, but many people harm him, so I didn't accept it as a comedy. Kitten travels from Ireland to London, always hoping for the best, usually receiving the worst, and never losing his faith in humanity. (More or less like Candide, only wearing a dress and high heels.) The Irish troubles are a central part of the plot, but--for me at least--it was hard to tell just who was shooting whom, and why. Finally, the Irish accents of some of the actors were so strong that I wished the film came with subtitles.This is an unusual film, and, on balance, it's probably worth seeing. However, I think that it would be more effective for someone who understands the subtleties and complexities of the Irish political and cultural climate.",positif
"I saw this on 10/2 at the NYFF-we got last minute tickets right up front. Neil Jordan was present at Q&A-an absolute treat. The film was simply wonderful from beginning to end--charming, emotionally satisfying, delicately nuanced and very powerful. The acting was sublime, as in all Jordan films. Cillian Murphy is so impossibly gorgeous and yet so fearless and skillful an actor, who uses his physicality to his supreme advantage. The Irish gang of three-Gleeson, Neeson and Rea, who usually appear in Jordan's films, were superb and touching as usual. There were wonderful casting touches--Bryan Ferry as a sicko, Gaivn Friday as a gay rockabilly, etc. The film was audacious, swerving mightily between broad comedy and grim tragedy. The most arresting elements were the amazing customes and the choice of 60s and 70s songs, something Jordan discussed in detail during the Q&A.I urge all cineastes to catch this one-you will be amazed and deeply satisfied.",positif
"I was very disappointed in ""Breakfast on Pluto."" The film starts out promisingly enough, particularly with the all too quickly abandoned device of the gossiping robins who provide some narrative exposition. Patrick's speculative fantasy about his conception also suggests that the fantastic will continue to play a role in his/her respective adventures, but again, this fades all too quickly. Eventually, his/her constant refrain of ""serious, serious, serious,"" become hard to take in light of the circumstances he/she comes to face.It's hard to develop any real sympathy for Patrick/Patricia Kitten. Even when we learn the source of his/her private pain, it comes so long after he/she has already been established as vain-glorious and thoroughly self-involved that it's truly hard to care.This is on top of the fact that besides being abandoned at birth, he/she seems to have been raised in a household whose sole restriction was that he/she not serve as a public embarrassment. While we might retrospectively recognize that his adopted mother's admonition that he repeat ""I am not a girl"" while roughly brushing him was not the most healthy response to his early trans-gender experimentation, the film offers little other reason for the audience to understand why Patrick was so rude to his adopted mother and sister.The movie's truly ""serious"" moments show some promise, as the acting is quite good (Gavin Friday and Liam Neeson are standouts)and the situations truly serious, but it's hard to care when Patrick/Patricia's concern about these situations is so fleeting. Some moments do stand out, particularly the scene in the abortion clinic and Fr. Benard's confession to Patrick/Patricia in the peepshow, but the rest of the film's most potentially poignant moments are cut short by the lead character's refusal to recognize the gravity of the situations in which he/she finds him/herself.",positif
"Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.Now about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).The acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.What's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!",positif
"The first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Fellowship of the Rings opened the door to a whole new world for me. I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I've read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.I loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR, but not quite, because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don't want to leave. I've never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again, with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment, maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings, and whatever age you are, when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard, Saruman, Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the ""good"" characters, but also with the ""evil"" ones. For example, Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman, and I can't imagine the movie without him.Some films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: The Fifth Element, the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV, V and VI (forget the newer prequels), the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part), Interview with a Vampire, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp), Logan's Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.But after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved books, Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema, one that I honestly think has not and won't be surpassed, at least not in my lifetime, not even by PJ himself.It is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film, for creating a world that is at my fingertips, only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want, and makes me forget everything else.The LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious, the non plus ultra of all movies!",positif
"(95%) If the late 70's early 80's had the Star wars trilogy, then the 2000's had this epic fantasy masterclass. Regardless of whether you're a fantasy fan or not this is too good a movie to simply pass up, and it will be one of those movies that given time will prove it to be a classic. The deeper you look into this the more one notices that every single aspect really is a truly impressive accomplishment. The fact that every single sword used by the main characters was made by hand, with extra ones made only for carrying, fighting, etc, then there's the costumes/armor/props all made by teams of many people. They even made artificial trees for gods sake. But really all those things are just extras, what really makes this a unique watch is that it really does feel huge and sweeping, the sense of scale is fantastic and I can't think of anything that even comes close to matching it. What every epic flick needs this has, the cast is great, it's exciting, it has bags of character, it's funny, sad, superbly well made, with a great score and plenty of action. It's also one of very few 2 hour 30 minute + movies ever that leaves the audience wanting more. Since watching it around Christmas 2001 at a packed out cinema, and the many times I've seen it on DVD since, it never fails to impress and charm. All in all near perfect cinematic treat that keeps on giving.",positif
"It took me a while to watch this film (2020), but it was the best I've ever seen, it is just fantastic, it needs no praise, I dare say that the Lord of the Rings trilogy is the best cinematographic work ever produced by mankind. Perfect.Film seen on August 8, 2020.",positif
"Here is one film that lived up to its hype, and by the time I saw it after it had arrived at the video stores, I had heard and read a ton of things about it, and seen all the awards it had received, and expected a lot. To my surprise, it did not disappoint.Now, several years later after having watched all three of these ""Rings"" films twice each, I still think this first movie of the trilogy is the best. It is a truly spectacular adventure story all the way through, probably the best ever put to film...and the first three hours of it is extra special. The following two films were very good, to be sure, but this first had a better mixture of the story. The second and third movies were almost entirely Frodo and his allies' long journey, but the first half of this movie also gives a good bit of interesting introductory material including a number of scenes at the Shire, before the long adventure starts. If you watch all three of these films consecutively the action wears you down by midway through the final episode and it almost becomes just too much That never gets a chance to happen with the ""Fellowship"" film.Anyway, ""Fellowship,"" stunned me for the visuals alone. I can't recall any film that has so many jaw-dropping scenes, one after the other, for three straight hours. Some are beyond description, and I don't care if they are computer- generated. So what? The fact is they are awesome to view, both in beauty and in staggering action scenes that feature incredible-looking monsters and other mythical characters.The story covers all kinds of terrain, too, from the lush Shire of the Hobbits, to the harsh neighboring landscapes. Each couple of minutes, as in the two movies that followed, scenes radically change from calmness to action, adventure to romance, sweet lovable characters to hideous monsters, on and on and on. It's an incredible movie experience.",positif
"An incredible feat
Enthrals anew every time
Cannot believe its two decades ago
Love it so much",positif
"...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, I'm 25 years old, and I've read ""The Lord of the Rings"" in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Silmarillion"" as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbo's table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in ""The Hobbit"" book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron. Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the audiobook version of 'Fellowship of the Ring' lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? I've read a reviewer saying he'd make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fast-forwarding experience of a movie with 'Alvin and the Chimpmunks' kind of voices, incredibly stupid to say the least.Ok, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Jackson's vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books, which may or may not be compatible with that of Jackson's, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien; that's the thing with books: each reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, the Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lorien, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.As for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the scene a lot. I did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politically-correct to do so, or that I find Liv Tyler to be absolutely attractive; it was just because I felt like even though it was a big change from the book, it was a very good one indeed, it makes you discover the power, determination, and courage of elves and the fact that even elven women, although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterparts. And beside, as Arwen is to become a Queen later on, it was pretty good to see her have a great first appearance.The actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I saw elves as they were, quick, agile, terrifyingly effective in battle - just look at how Legolas dealed with the hordes of enemies without a single hint of fear in his eyes - these are elves as they should be. Gimli was great too, I know people seem to think many characters were not developed enough, but by the actions you can learn a lot. With Gimli a lot can be learned about the dwarves, their pride, deep sense of honor and family, their mistrust of elves, their love for strong beer and a good fight against anything bigger, and their sheer hatred for orcs and the likes. Aragorn was totally the ranger character, the ending scene as he walked toward the horde of Uruk-Hai warriors was great, his attitude, his clothes, everything about him just cried ""ranger"". Boromir was very well depicted, desperate to save the people of Gondor, by any mean necessary, robbed of all hope, yet in the end he redeems himself by showing his true valour, deep down, he's willing to die to defeat evil, and when he recognizes his king in Aragorn, on his last breath, I felt like watching a hero die, it was moving. The hobbits were all great, Frodo is deeply sad and fatalist, and Sam is just the 'best friend' everyone would like to have, just as it should be. Finally, we have Gandalf, quite frankly, he looks mighty, Ian IS Gandalf. The faceoff against the Balrog in the Moria is a memorable sequence, and just shows how strong he really is, to be able to vanquish such a foe. I can't wait for his return.Quite frankly, I can't wait for the two other movies... In the meantime, I'll watch this one over and over again. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually read books that have more pages than the average little 25¢ novel that has no value in it, which is great. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsiblity, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. This is worthy of Tolkien, this is a movie that will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure.",positif
"***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Today is my birthday. Honestly, it is. It has been a beautiful week. Actually, it has been more than beautiful. The first snow has slowly covered our trees, the cool winterair has boldly taken over the days and nights in Norway. Beautiful. Well, actually, it has been more than beautiful. But what is `more than beautiful'? Today it was the point where a touch of evil was added to the beautiful. And with the evil and the beautiful comes. well, you know where I am getting at. A thrilling adventure, ancientic tale-greatness, monstrous experiences and totally - with no doubts whatsoever - the one film to rule them all. And in MY MIND, bind me. to this film, this book, forever. From heart of someone who has not read the book, nor have any interest in Tolkien, but loves cinema more than anything in the world. this is one of my, if not THE, all-time cinematic moments.Norway is a small country. And for the small country - only one press screening of FOTR. A small bit about me. I love film, and work as a filmjournalist here in Oslo. Therefore I attended this press-screening. My relation to LOTR is quite simple. Have not read the book, but have been covering the developments of the films. And by that, I have grown a huge interest for the project. Enough now. I HAD AN URGE TO REVIEW THIS MOVIE. Because it is beyond anything I could expect, want, crave, imagine, desire, feel, anticipate. This is unimaginable. And when you see it. I found myself crying of nothing but admiration 2 minutes into the prologue (shiveringly spoken by Blanchett). It shows this dark lord, Sauron, and tells a the fascinating story of The One Ring. Now, excuse me for not being OBSESSIVELY AWARE of everything about this movie (or these books) before seeing or writing this. The prologue is nothing but a amazing sequence. Instead of going into each and every picture (frame) of this film (because I could, and there would be a lot to gaze at and analyse in every single one of them), I will say this: THERE IS SO MUCH. I was completely paralysed. I love every detail I could observe, from the complex battlescenes to the single face of mister Frodo Baggins bedazzling every single audience member. It was a fantastic experience. This review, as I can see, will turn into a not-cronologic piece, but forgive me - my thoughts are a bit hard to recollect. My mind is occupied with images that have burned hard to my iris, performances that I already love and quote. I walked out of the theater 7 hours ago.I have not read the books, as you can see. Now I have seen the first film, and a big bouldering voice tells me that I might have had this very experience many years earlier, by way of the book. But people, and I feel this is important to say, I've just read the book. I think. A 3 hour movie - it felt like reading a book. Because the film felt so massive, it has layers upon layers - in character, in dialogue, in scenery (oh, my lord, the set pieces. I have fallen in love with Lothlorien, the Shire. Can I go to these places for vacation? Will I ever have enough money to go to New Zealand? This is so bloody fantastic in this film. It is so fantastic! I run out of words (especially in my English :-). We must go on!There has been a few hours as I said to dwell on this movie now, buit it's coming to me. It's coming to me as a grandiose wave of river-water lifted by the spellbinding of Arwen (Liv Tyler looks so stylish, such a timeless beauty. Eventhough (some stupid, boneheaded) people are going to scream ARMAGEDDON when they see her the first time, they will be silent when this elf is riding away from the black riders - bravely coming the halfling to rescue.) to eliminate ringwraiths(?). IT IS SO VERY, VERY GOOD. (Oh, I love this film. I have to see it again. I need my mother to see this film, I need to pick up a total stranger on the street, offer her a ticket just to see her face when she's leaving the theatre. I may have given her a lifetime of. well, an experience for a lifetime. Do you hear that Peter Jackson? You may very well, with this masterpiece (I have been dying to call it that), been responsible for thousands of people suffering through this year.) I NEED TO SEE TWO TOWERS NOW!!!! WHAT AM I GOING TO DO!!?? READ THE BOOK? I have to know whats happens. That thing happening to Gandalf. I can't believe it. He must return. Tell me he returns. Ian McKellen is superior. He is great. He acts like if. well, I couldn't see him act. There is Gandalf in him. For sure. Well, anyway, I am off track.FOTR is very big. A big tale. But very small. I mean, big it is, but small is he - Frodo. Oh my gracious lord of modern cinema, the very man who gave Mr. And Mrs. The liberty to create the god given actor named Elijah. Nothing crazy about these sentences, but it is a holy great performance. He is feeling. He is a feeling. My back was cold throughout the entire movie. Feeling Frodo, being Frodo, hurting Frodo, bearing with Frodo. A class-act, truly enchanting, spectacular, it-is-no-good-words-to-compliment-enough Frodo. I am, as you just read, trying to verbalize my experience of Frodo Baggins. But this turns away from reviewing. You want to read about the content of the film. What I saw. Because most of you probably know the whole story, and all the characters. Well, let's go to what there is to see.
I saw the Shrine. It is a very richly realistic built, sunny, green place. I loved it. But no surprises. The home of Bilbo, cornfields. and then the city of Bir? Bie? Forgot the name. All the way, amazing scenery. The fact that there is a big difference in height among the characters, but not among the actors, well that is, how do I put it, flawless. Don't know how they could pull it off, but I am impressed. As I said before, this is so throughoutly worked on and polished - every picture and frame has something more than what you see, and every character blows my mind. What can I say? I'm never this singlemindledly positive about a film, but this may very well be THAT ONE where everything seems to strike my mind and in, again, the cinematic darkness bind me. Every generation has a movie. Every saga has a. hehe, enough filmrelated quotings. Don't have to say much about this, but so that you know it: Howard Shore's score is in my cd-player, and this music is. next to my heart.Bilbo. Just what did I actually know about this Bilbo. Oh, yes he was that hobbit-guy that picked up the Ring from the creature Gollum. I have read the forewords of LOTR. But oh my god. Complexity lies hidden, it seems, in each and every character. Bilbo freaked my out. Scared me more than Gollum (`my precious' shivers still in my bones). What exactly did that ring do to him? One scene has given me the most disturbance (and if someone does not want to know, please do not read further). When Frodo reaches Lothlorien, and re-meets with Bilbo, there is screen magic. As they talk (and he looks so much older already), he gives Frodo the sword. He tells about it's magic, how it glows blue when orcs are near. Ian Holm is absolutely heartbreaking as Bilbo. Then comes a moment. It hit my spine. He wants to give Frodo the armor (what was it called again?), and Frodo begins to remove his shirt. Then Bilbo sees the ring. Oh s**t, he sees the ring. Ian Holm is magic. ""Oh, can I hold it... just for one last time..."" ""No, Bilbo, stay away"". ""IT's MINE! MY RING! MY PRECIOUS!"" It is at that point. Bilbo freaks out. Make-up is brilliant, and the scare of that moment, that scene... still won't leave my body. Not even my damn mind. And the same thing happens with Galadriel. Don't want to spoil anything but the scene with Galadriel and Frodo by the mirror (she pours water in it, and he sees ""what is to come""). THIS IS MAGIC!!!! Aaahhh. Again, and I can't say this enough, I HAVE TO SEE THIS MOVIE AGAIN. Believe me, it is THAT GOOD. The film hadn't played for long, but I began to realise. what's next for Frodo. He is now the ringebearer. Look at Bilbo. Again it strikes me.. I HAVE TO SEE THE NEXT TO FILMS NOW!!! Because there is no end to this film. Actually I couldn't believe it ended when it did. I needed more. It felt like one hour tops, but I had been nailed to my seat for 3 hours already. Amazing experience. The film have no ending, and there's evil there, that does not sleep . Now you get the picture; I love this film! I love LORD OF THE RINGS. This is just remarkable. My imagination. oh, I have no imagination. I did not, could not, imagine this. Imagine there's no people. Imagine if this film had not been made. I may have lived my life without knowing this story. All of you who read the book and hate them for turning this into a movie. Think of all of us who now have been rescued from living our lives without it. Thank you, everyone behind this film, for making it.Koola from NorwayA small PS: The fellowship. It was beautifully casted. Flawless. Gimli - unforgettable John Rhys-Davies. The hobbits - just charming to their hairy feet, and they touched me deep. Aragorn and Boromir - more than anything, believable. They are men, they have no effects or make-up to characterize them. But they are massive. They suffer, and it hurts. Viggo Mortensen is my hero. (And did you all know he is related to Denmark, my neighbourcountry?). Legolas though.. He was my favourite. Feels weird to write the least about the character I loved the most, but it's just. not much to say. Could not stand seeing Legolas leave the screen, he had an remarkable impact on me with his. elvish magic. Oh, and one last thing. This is a chaos. My mind is a chaos. FOTR is so much, much more. I haven't said a thing about Galladriel, and a lot more. But there has to be a limit. If I were you now, I would look forward to every second of this film, so then. it does not matter.
I will bring this experience with me for the rest of my life. It is that good.",positif
"""For the time will soon come when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.""
GaladrielGaladriel tells Hobbits may look like unimportant people but they will change the course of the future. Story begins with this line.This line is not really the first line but the line stars the movie for real. This movie is breathtaking. Whatever I say is not enough for this trilogy. Brilliant novel, brilliant adapted screenplay.Not just the novel or screenplay is excellent but the technics also revolutionary. The trilogy nearly opened a new era to Cinema. Some believed even more revolutionary than Star Wars and 2001: A Space Odyssey. Amazing makeup, breathtaking visual effects, stunning cinematography. The trilogy nearly succeed at all technical subjects.",positif
"Director Peter Jackson and wife Fran Walsh have successfully created an epic movie in both look and feel to equal J. R. R. Tolkien's novel (itself awarded the title of ""book of the century""), bringing to the big screen a film nearly flawless in its execution. My biggest disappointment is that two chapters are missing from the novel - Tom Bombadil and the following encounter with the barrow-wrights - but everything else is present and correct.Visually the film is stunning, and Jackson's decision to shoot it entirely in New Zealand is one that pays off. From the incredibly lush green opening scenes of the Shire, to the enchanting elvish woods, to the imposing mountains and plains, it really is a great film to look at and enjoy the backdrop. Even the computer-generated images, like that of Mount Doom, are pretty realistic. Jackson's fluid camera leads to some great sweeping shots through orc-infested mines, huge towers, cameras in places you've never dreamed of. The soundtrack is also perfect, with Howard Shore's suspenseful, exciting, and emotional score a real plus, especially with the cool chanting that fills the Mines of Moria sequence. On top of this, great stuff is done with sound effects - in particular one scene involving a horn suddenly blowing had me jumping in my seat with its realism.I don't really need to examine the story, because it sticks closely to the book with so few minor changes that it's impeccable. The script is intelligent and well-written, the characters charismatic and believable in the situations they encounter. Despite a three hour running time, the film never drags, even in some of the slower sequences - I just didn't want it to be over while I was watching it. The costumes, sets and appearances - down to the hobbits' hairy feet - are all exactly as you would picture them in the book. Jackson's bizarre, arty depiction of life in the ""netherworld"" when Frodo puts on the ring and becomes invisible is as good as it could ever have been - spooky, supernatural and utterly weird. Lighting, pacing, suspense, tension, and the rest - it's all here and done 100% correctly for an overall brilliant effect.Elijah Wood seemed an odd choice to me for the lead role, but I immediately fell in love with his character. Through his acting he creates an emotional, weak in body but strong in spirit hero, a real centre piece for the film to evolve around, and the film makes great use of the actor's slightly odd eyes (especially in the sequence in which he nearly becomes a wraith). Ian McKellen is also excellent as Gandalf and seems to have been perfectly cast in the role, making it his own. Then there's the fellowship itself - Viggo Mortensen excels as the proud and just Strider (later Aragorn), especially in the action stakes where he fights with such fierce determination that he's a presence to behold. Orlando Bloom is fine as the elf warrior Legolas, and moves as fast with his bow as he does in the book. Screen stalwart John Rhys-Davies IS Gimli the dwarf, and couldn't be better. Then there's Sean Astin - lovable as the dopey but loyal Sam Gamgee, and Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan in slight comic relief roles as hobbit buddies Pip and Merry. Finally, kudos to Sean Bean, for creating in Boromir a flawed but deeply likable and understandable character, with a sympathetic performance that eclipses all of the actor's previous work - bravo.The action sequences are magnificent and really get the heart going - they put you into the middle of the action with all the blood, sweat and clanging steel, and are edge-of-the-seat stuff. Highlights include Strider fighting the ring-wraiths with his burning brand on Weathertop and the final assault by orcs on the fellowship, which leads to one of the most noble deaths ever in a film. And what of the special effects? In a film dominated by CGI work, I'm happy to say that most are unnoticeable. The digital manipulation to create four-foot hobbits is sometimes dodgy but most of the time you don't notice. The backdrops and effects are great, expensive looking but solid and real at the same time - whoever said they look ""cartoony"" just got it wrong.My favourite scene in the movie is the Mines of Moria sequence - a fantasy fan's dream come true, and the best on screen depiction of a Dungeons & Dragons game so far. The lurker in the lake is a Lovecraftian monster par excellence and the spooky and atmospheric trip through the corpse-strewn deserted mines exceptionally eerie stuff. Then follows a fantastic battle with a cave troll, thankfully on screen for a fair amount of time so we get to admire the fluid and superb effects, and then a truly gob-smacking encounter with the fiery Balrog, just as you imagine it from the book. This half an hour is probably the best film sequence I've ever seen, flawless and perfect in its depiction - amazing. A highlight of what is an impressive and epic film throughout, and a must see for any film fan worth their salt - I can't recommend this film highly enough, and plan to watch it again before the cinema run expires. In my opinion this is better than any STAR WARS movie or HARRY POTTER - and easily one of the best fantasy movies ever made, although it has to be said the competition isn't exactly stiff. Bring on the sequel!",positif
"I think it is important to remember that Peter Jackson took up this film not in order just to make a film of `The Lord of the Rings' but because he wanted to make a 'fantasy just like the `The Lord of the Rings'"" as he himself put it.  After repeating that phrase on a number of occasions the question popped into his mind: ""Well, why not the `The Lord of the Rings' itself?"".  In doing this he, of course, set himself an enormous challenge: he had to make a really good `fantasy' film, one which would stand on its own and be true to what he had originally wanted to do but he would also, and here the task he had set himself was enormous, be true to the original book and to make a film which the legions of people who have loved this book would feel happy with.  In the latter task he was certainly not helped by the author or the book: Tolkein, it would seem, hated cinema.  The book itself is `HUGE': this was not going to be the kind of task that the James Ivory team set themselves, or Scorsese nor the kind of task facing Branagh with Hamlet; nor was it going to be like the puny task that faced Columbus with `Harry Potter' who had the bigger budget ($130 million for one film as compared with Peter Jackson with $300m for three).I have just seen the first `volume' and can say without hesitation that he has succeeded in both his goals.  It is not the book but a reading of the book which is inventive and fascinating.  It is the kind of experience that makes you want to go back and reread the whole thing in the light of the emphases that Jackson has brought to the story.  He focuses on the corrupting influence of the ring and, through this focus, the character of the chief protagonists of the story are revealed.  Clearly those most tempted by it are mortal men (Boromir and even, in one moment, Aragorn), those who already have power (Elrond - `The ring cannot stay here'; Galadriel; Gandalf and Saruman),  and, of course, those who would not normally desire it but who by accident become ring bearers - Gollum, Bilbo, Frodo.  I can see why, in this reading, Jackson decided to leave out the Bombadil episode.  Bombadil, like the Balrog, is beyond the ring but the latter is important to the unfolding of the story of the fates of all the characters, Bombadil isn't.It is a miracle of this reading of the first volume of the book that one can see where Jackson is going and one can get a feel of how the reading is going to unfold.  In a sense, Jackson's real trial - as far as those who know the books are concerned - will come with the second film in the series. He has lived up to our expectation by creating even bigger ones: how can he handle the story of the chase andrescue of Merry and Pippin, the storming of Isengard etc - stories which don't really add much to the core theme that is emerging.  Or is he now going to add the theme of the great contest of good versus evil to the unfolding reading?All of this points to the fact that the film, even though it is a feast of special effects, focuses on character.  And this also explains why Jackson chose the actors he did for their roles: they are not `big' names - no `Sean Connery', no `Alan Rickman', no `Brad Pitt', no `Sam Neill'etc.  He didn't want them getting in the way of the story of character.  Ian McKellan's talents, in particular, are used to tell a large proportion of the story: an enormous amount is conveyed simply through his facial expressions and even by the language of his body. The other miracle in all of this is Elijah Wood.  Like many others, when I first heard of Jackson's choice, I groaned: but Wood has been extraordinary.  He brings, as one friend said, a strange kind of androgyny to the role and this is just perfect. McKellan has already been knighted: give Wood the Oscar.And then there is Middle Earth: this is, as someone put it, another character in the story and the New Zealand landscape, digitally enhanced on occasion, lives up to its role too.Enough.  See this film!  Greatest film ever made?  How can one make a claim like that! Silly really; as silly as claiming that `The Lord of the Rings' is the greatest book ever written.  Can't one simply love a story, enjoy reading it a number of times amd lose oneself in it.  One CAN claim that it is the greatest work in its genre as is the film.10/10",positif
"Alright, I liked the movie, but I have mixed feelings.First of all, you gotta give Jackson credit for his work, but it seems to me, that though he did a good job over all he did not really catch the magic of the books - and I don't mean in the movies, but he himself. The special-effects, the cast and and the production are great - but for every acceptable or good change to the original story you find at least the same amount of really bad choices Jackson made. Let me just give the example of who is responsible for going through Moria in the book and on the other hand in the movie. Why change it to Frodo and give him the burden of Gandalf's death? Why do not let Aragorn take the broken sword out of Rivendell? These are just needless and bad changes to the original story, and there are more examples for that kind of things.But nevertheless the movies made a break for the fantasy-genre and will spawn a lot of movies from the same kind (or so I hope). Jackson deserves credit for that. The Lord of the Rings is something you have to see - but not something you have to like.",positif
"Barely ever hearing of The Lord of the Rings, I went in to see this film in theaters the consecutive Friday it was released, to not only be flabbergasted at its greatness, but wanting more! Since then, I devoted myself to seeing the following two films on the first day of release -- a promise I kept.Peter Jackson's take on Tolkien's fantasy masterpiece not only carries a great deal of the text to full film fruition, but shows the power of film, and proving that nothing is impossible. Jackson's vision is continuous, and never seems to loose grasp of the story that is being told. Using the artistry of John Howe and Alan Lee, The Fellowship of the Ring gleams with a beautiful and dark atmosphere, a length of detail that makes it seem like everyone and everything has its own history, and full of wondrous images one could never imagine.The acting is superb. With a complex script, each actor has transformed these characters into 3-D people with deep back-story, and people that we feel compassion for. This is one extraordinary ensemble cast. Each actor IS that character, making it seem impossible to imagine anyone else fill that person's shoe in their stead. Viggo Mortensen IS Aragorn. Sir Ian McKellen IS Gandalf the Grey. Elijah Wood IS Frodo Baggins. One could weep with our heroes should one fall, or feel inspired when they achieve victory. A fantasy with this much emotion just seems surreal, but it's completely believable.Never losing pace, the writing and direction is flawless, making for one enthralling introduction into Middle-earth. The voice over prologue fills even the most uneducated audience member with all the necessary knowledge they need to know in order to understand our heroes' and villains' motives. Some things of course have been omitted for pacing reasons. While not present in the theatrical cut, we do see the passing of the Grey Elves, and get a brief tale of Beren and Luthien. The barrow-wights and their story is no where to be seen (as interesting as it is in the book, there really is no place for it in this film) and Tom Bombadil is absent as well, but thankfully to the ingeniousness of the writers, in the Extended Edition of The Two Towers a little homage is paid to the character. Omissions and changes are always part of adapting a book to film, and the ones made by Peter Jackson, Phillipa Boyens and Fran Walsh are justifiable in every way.The action scenes are spaced out thoroughly enough for breathing room, plot advancement, and ever-continuing character development. Each action scene is its own, be it the flight to the Fjords of Bruinen, the Mines of Moria, or the showdown at Amon Hen near the end of the film. All are greatly choreographed, each stunt member and actor is full of energy and ambition as they wield deadly weapons at each others' heads and limbs. It really is a sight to behold.The special effects are mesmerizing. The use of CGI, miniatures/bigatures, and even clever camera angles blend to make one ideal image after the other. The soaring images of Barad-dur or Orthanc seem real when in fact, they only stand so many feet high. The Argonath, two figures of enormous height standing before the Anduin River seem like 300 foot creations, when in fact they are about only several feet off the ground. Simply jaw-dropping imagery.Howard Shore's score for The Fellowship of the Ring is a beautiful, epic, and complex piece of work that makes one feel like they have been entranced. Even when some of the text seems omitted from the screen, it can be heard through the powerful instrumentation conducted and created by this composer. The use of leitmotifs to symbolize a country, race, or character is stunning.Overall, The Lord of the Rings - The Fellowship of the Ring is a visionary masterpiece, allowing the world to see what seems like actual history with fantastic elements, equaling the greatness of Hollywood's earlier classics. As the first of three, one who has not seen these films can await the next several hours of their lives to be changed for ever.",positif
"Absolutely epic! The scale is truly mind blowing. Every filmmaking aspect is beyond incredible. Especially the score, set design & dialogue. The emotional weight & amazing battles seal it.",positif
"When I first read ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy back in the early 1970's, I recall saying to myself that the story would make a wonderful movie. ""Star Wars"" still hadn't come out yet, and realizing that the available technology could not do justice to the fantastic world presented by J.R.R. Tolkien, it was simply best left to the imagination.Well, imagination has found life in ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", a truly profound epic that sets the standard for film fantasy, just as the books did for the written word. Upon first seeing it during it's initial release, I couldn't have been happier with the amount of detail it offered while remaining true to the original adventure. Everyone imagines what a story and characters look like in their own mind; it was as if Peter Jackson tapped a great cosmic consciousness to deliver a tale that captured the tone and pacing of the novel dead on.I feel that readers of the trilogy have a leg up on the characters and locations of Middle Earth, as they are revealed in the film quickly and with nominal explanation. For example, when the Black Riders appear for the first time, it's difficult to grasp what they're all about, other than the fact that they're after the ring. Strider's explanation of the Nazgul is perfect - ring wraiths who were once men, neither alive nor dead, who always feel the power of the ring. Coming to the movie with that understanding ahead of time helps the viewer have a greater appreciation of the action taking place.The real magic of the movie for me is the seamless manner in which the various races coexist and interact with each other. Though levels of unfamiliarity and distrust appear, can anyone coming out of the movie doubt that elves, dwarfs, hobbits and wizards actually exist. Even orcs and evil Uruk hai have a place in this world, for without the danger they pose there is no triumph.If the movie captures your imagination and you haven't read the trilogy or it's prequel ""The Hobbit"", you'll be doing yourself a favor to do so. There in even more exquisite detail are nuances such as Elvish poetry and additional characters that provide more depth and color to the world of Middle Earth. It's a world easy to get lost in, and makes one appreciate a writer of legendary proportion who invented a land, people, and language all of his own that can now be shared with everyone.",positif
"A mild mannered hobbit named Frodo, back by eight companions has to face all manner of danger, battling many foes in order to save Middle Earth.I'm not sure I can say much that hasn't been said multiple times, it truly is one of the greatest movies ever made, foolishly I have only watched it once since its original release, and tonight I was as captivated, entertained and genuinely spellbound as I was when I first saw it.Action packed, dramatic, emotional and entertaining, this film has it all, there are no lulls, it entertains you from start to finish, an impressive feat for a film that runs over three hours long.The visuals are sensational, from the glorious landscapes, incredibly costumes and makeup, to the dazzling special effects, you truly are transported to a world of pure fantasy.The music is spot on too, who doesn't love to hear Enya.The acting is phenomenal, credit to all involved, Wood, Lee, McKellen, Blanchett, Mortensen and all concerned are terrific, being a huge Sean Bean fan I have to comment on his amazing performance.It's a fabulous movie.10/10.",positif
The Lord Of The Rings TrilogyPerhaps the best adaptation of a gargantuan novel ever made thus far.Words defy analysis but in short all the forces are martialled by Peter Jackson in service of the story that is enabled with a breadth and scope never before achieved before this.,positif
"Star Wars has been dethroned.  Although George Lucas' movies are good in their own right (except for the juvenile elements he puts in to sell toys to finance the franchise), his scripts (which borrow heavily from J.R.R.Tolkien, mythology & religion) can't compare with the brilliance of the literary trilogy `The Lord of the Rings'.  Granted, Lucas took on a herculean task in writing & directing his story himself, but Tolkien's words, along with Peter Jackson's faithful adaptation & inspired vision, have created something no one man could equal. Of course, it helps that Jackson insisted on at least a 2 picture deal, & New Line Cinema was brave enough to foot the bill up front for 3 movies. They spent $180 million to film all 3 simultaneously.  With the New Zealand exchange rate, that equals $360 million ($90 million ea.), but since they used many of the same sets, and FX development costs were spread throughout, we're seeing $120-$150 million on the screen.  This will ensure consistency in plot, casting, tone, etc.In 3 hours, Jackson has crammed everything essential from the first novel & then some into the film, rewriting some scenes & dialogue with lesser characters for the leads, leaving out only what there wasn't enough time for.  Basically, you have two 90 min. movies running back to back.  There are no slow spots, just one climax after another.  From the opening 10 min. backstory where the Dark Lord Sauron is shown on the battlefield wiping out men & elves 10 at a time with each swing of his mace, I was blown away.  The romance between Aragorn, king in exile, and Arwen, daughter of the elf-lord, is played up for the ""Titanic"" quotient, but it's well done. The story, sets, costumes & FX are so rich, you'll have to see the film several times to absorb everything.  The unspoiled New Zealand locales are spectacular, providing a variety of environments to represent the different settings on the characters' journey.  The location sets are imaginative, detailed & weathered, adding to their believability, while the studio sets match them in meticulousness.  The costumes are at once familiar & strange, drawing on both the medievil & the fantastic, but more important, they're also functional & practical.  The music by Howard Shore is appropriately sweeping, Celtic & folky in keeping with the novel, although it lacks the memorable themes of John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith, but neither would commit a year or more to a 3 picture project.  The FX are as they should be, unobtrusive & unnoticed most of the time, there only to support the story not draw attention away from it as in most Hollywood movies which try to coverup illogical plots & bad acting. I'm particularly gratified by the casting of Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn which was a last minute stroke of luck when the actor first chosen for the part backed out due to differences with the director.  I've always thought Mortenson had an intensity & striking but not pretty-boy looks that could portray a flawed, dangerous hero instead of the villains Hollywood always picked him for.A stellar cast giving some of their best performances, visuals that deliver beyond what I imagined, a perfect mix of humor, passion & tragedy, and a feeling of grandeur, scope & impending doom.  Perhaps as an ensemble piece with so many characters & the inability to concentrate on any one, it can't be measured against some of the classic character study films, but even the casual moviegoer can grasp the ideas & not get lost  As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the greatest films of all time.",positif
"It took me 14 years and a subscription to HBO Max to get around to watching this movie, and I can certainly say it was worth every bit of hype it gets. The Fellowship of the Ring was an epic start and one of the best fantasy adventure films I've ever seen. These action sequences are immaculate, and it is a gorgeously directed movie, the cinematography was so good I couldn't get enough.It's also very, very funny, who knew Sean Astin, who I love, would grow up to be a hobbit, every actor in this gives a really great performance, and these special effects are top-tier, they're unbelievable.The Fellowship of the Ring also has one of the greatest climaxes I've ever seen, not only that, it has incredible creatures that actually scared me.Yes, it is very, very long with a runtime of nearly 3 hours, but it never drags despite that.Peter Jackson had a vision here, and it was an amazing vision, along with a story that was epic.And I'm gonna give Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring an A+",positif
"It's possible we've become too familiar with this film and its two successors. Time, and multiple rewatching as, can cause us to forget how impossible the whole project seemed before the world saw it; we forget how strange and independent spirited parts of it are; we forget the references too and evidence of Jackson's roots in horror cinema; we forget the narrative excitement that propels a film adapted from a source that is more discursive, more of a scene-setter. Changes made from the text aid this, and the result is thrilling and wonder-inducing. It's a masterful piece of epic fantasy cinema, and the whole trilogy's place in my heart is secure.",positif
"There's a ring that's been residing in a pocket, provides longevity to Bilbo who's a Hobbit, but it's waiting to be found, by Sauron to which it's bound, you need the fires of Mount Doom, if you're to stop it. Frodo (who has been given the ring by Bilbo) and his chums go on a journey, become pursued by an increasingly large army, comprising orcs and nasty wraiths, hunting them down from place to place, it's quite bizarre, and very often, a bit barmy. They're supported on this quest by Dwarves and Elves, plus there are people very similar to ourselves, and a wizard with a beard, has a hat that's quite dog-eared, some have magic, on occasion they cast spells.",positif
"Peter Jackson truly outdid himself when creating the Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring and he fails to disappoint us in the 2nd part of the Trilogy. The Two Towers shows us that he is not a one-hit wonder, like so many directors are. I actually think that The Two Towers reaches the same level as the Fellowship of the Ring, and sometimes even surpasses it.This film is the biggest film in the trilogy. What do I mean by that? Well this film has so many things going like the amazing Battle of Helms Deep. Frodo and Sam journey to Mount Doom, to destroy the Ring. But the one who's leading them through the way is Gollum, he looks so creepy and realistic, that he doesn't feel disconnected from us. A powerful performance by Andy Serkis as Gollum, he should of been nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor.The Best part of the film, is quite easily and everyone knows it the ending. The ending of the battle of Helm's Deep is quite breathtaking, and as Gandalf the White comes in the distance with another army to defeat the Orcs. When Treebeard and his army of Entz tear down Isengard, the destruction and the battle is so immense in size, that you truly have to see to believe.In size and scale, Peter Jackson has truly redefined the word ""epic"" and he also pays attention to the small things that truly elevate this movie from great to amazing. I definitely recommend this film to everyone, but you really should watch the first movie to truly understand what's going on.10/10",positif
"It seems ridiculous to want to add my own comments to a slew of others that are already in IMDB's records, but I feel like I cannot sleep nor cease the throbbing in my chest until I release some of what I have so recently seen.Peter Jackson's The Lord of the Rings is one of the bravest projects ever attempted by a filmmaker. Mr Jackson deserves every ovation he will receive, every award, every bit of the praise and adoration that will be spoken and written.This second installment of the story is a masterpiece in every sense, forget your prejudices about the books, they are another way of looking at this beautiful story (I know this is slightly against the rules, but a I cannot resist saying that a previous writers comment - a comment that compared the Lord of the Rings Films and Books to the difference between Romeo and Juliet in screenplay and ballet formats - was entirely accurate).Gollum was an excellent amalgam, so easily could he have been an annoying Jar-Jar-Binks-Alike. Instead the way that Jackson and Serkis (and doubtless many many others) chose to portray the CGI incarnation of ""Smeagol"" was incredibly emotive and powerful. Gollum is profoundly disturbing, amusing, almost lovable... Not even John Ronald Reuel himself could induce that range of emotions for Smeagol in me...A truly skin-crawling performance by a superb Brad Douris as the evil Grima Wormtongue was just beyond words. Douris _Became_ Wormtongue in a skillful fulfillment of what was already inspired casting.Probably the most definitive casting of this film though was Manchester born Bernard Hill as Theoden, King of Rohan. The casting for ""The Two Towers"" makes one shake ones head and wonder, in retrospect, whether anyone else could have filled these roles. Mr Hill's performance was truly first rate, a performance which contributed greatly to ""The Battle of Helms Deep"", scenes which were a spinning tornado of emotions for the viewer.Viggo Mortensen goes from strength to strength. His performance is visceral and yet sensitive. The overriding emotion that Tolkiens vision of Aragorn induced (at least for me) was awe at his heroics. Mortensen's portrayal in Jackson's frame brings new aspects to the Aragorn character. Mortensen's Aragorn is emotionally dextrous to go with his physical dexterity, he is sensitive, seemingly empathic, warmer and more fundamentally human, and yet super-human in presence and charisma. ""Definitive"" is not strong enough of a word.If you still view Jackson's epic with scepticism I implore you to put down your preconceptions and your prejudices, but most of all put down the books... This is beautiful way to see middle earth, don't pass it up - The books are the ultimate fantasy epic - the pictures you draw in your head are better than anything you can imagine, but The Lord of the Rings ""The Two Towers"" is one wonderful interpretation of that epic story.Go, Laugh, Cry, and Sit in Awe of this cinematic treat.",positif
"The Fellowship of the Ring was a monumentally entertaining film, the Return of the King was an amazing wrap-up to the epic of our times, but the most dramatic moment for me came at the end of the Two Towers. After 3 hours of sweeping vistas, excellent Shakespearean acting, and otherworldly sights and sounds, we are treated to a scene that still sends chills down my back and rouses me like nothing since the final scene in Rocky. A lone rider (we all know who), set against the top of a hill, massing legions of horsemen behind him. He appears just as the heroes are losing all hope. Once he begins his descent down the hill with his army behind him, the camera begins a slow pan over the top and down with them, showing the size and scale of their forces. The evil army below looks up with surprise, a bright light fills the screen, the camera focuses on the lead rider (again, we all know who) who lets out a wrenching battle cry, the music swells to unbelievable heights, and I am swept away like I've never been before.This is cinema at its very best.",positif
"From the beginning to the very end, the Lord of the Rings trilogy is interesting and enjoyable. The books and the movies alike grasp one's attention as if they were real. You, the reader or viewer, can sense the pain of the characters, their emotions. The trilogy is truly powerful on screen. The second movie, however, I believe has something the first and third are missing; it feels like a bridge connecting two great islands. There is something unique about it that cannot easily be described. Metaphorically, the first movie is, say, a soldier. The third movie is the path home from war. And the second movie is the act of coming home because it contains the obstacles that must be passed through before achieving the goal. Although not 100% loyal to the written trilogy, the movies are done in such a way that the mainstream audience and LOTR fans from before the movies came out can say they were enjoyable and well made.",positif
"""The Lord of the Rings"" continues it's epic quest in this second installment of the trilogy, as the original fellowship is disbanded and it's various members must continue the good fight. While Frodo and Sam pursue their mission to Mordor, Pippin and Merry manage to escape the Uruk hai into the Fangorn Forest and their own adventure with the Ents. Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli traverse the Riddermark into the realm of Rohan.The One Ring begins to deepen it's spell over Frodo who questions his worthiness and stomach for the mission. This facet of his character allows Sam (Sean Astin) to portray his devotion and loyalty to his master, particularly when Gollum makes his appearance and becomes their guide. Gollum's looks are rivaled only by his treachery, and the duality of his personality is given emphasis in the tortured conversations he has with himself. I was a bit surprised at the way Gollum was portrayed in ""The Two Towers""; his cameo appearance in the first film as a slinky black cave denizen more closely resembled Tolkien's description and corresponded to the mental image I took away when reading about it. At the same time though, there was almost a comic element to it, whereas his physical features presented here more accurately allowed for a menacing but tortured creature.Even more fantastic creatures find CGI life in the film; I found the presentation of the Ents to be masterfully done. The ""olyphants"" were a neat touch and I was happy to see them included. Of course the orcs, wargs and Uruk hai all personify the evil that befalls Middle Earth in this dire time, and their presence instills fear and dread for the heroes all along the way.There's a lot going on in the film, and repeated viewings are helpful, along with an understanding created by reading Tolkien's story. Though not entirely necessary to enjoy the movie, I feel it grounds the viewer in the rich background of the characters and locations. Actually, the books and the film complement each other nicely, even though the movie of necessity must leave out some elements.There is no doubt that ""The Lord of the Rings"" has earned it's reputation as one of the greatest epic films of all time and the best fantasy film of them all. At the same time, it does a wonderful job of examining such themes as honor, loyalty, friendship and love as it's characters interact with each other and find common ground against a threat to their very existence.",positif
"The opening scene of The Two Towers provides an outstanding, yet very brief, taste of action, cinematography, and special effects, only to be matched (and far surpassed) in the final hour of the film. The stunning events of the third hour of The Two Towers are undoubtedly the centerpiece of the film, and while the first two hours serve finely as story development, they primarily build anticipation for the final hour, which mostly depicts the battle of Helm's Deep. More than anything else, the first two hours merely tease and torment the patient audience. It's a shame that such a gap has to exist between the first minute and the final hour, but I take no reservations in saying that despite how you feel about the first two hours of the film, the final hour will make the wait entirely worth its while.As stated, the road to the battle of Helm's Deep can be enormously long and painful for any viewer aware of what breathtaking scenes await towards the end of the film. Perhaps The Two Towers' biggest fault is in its own accomplishments; the first two thirds of the film are well shot, well paced, and they necessarily and adequately progress the storyline, but when compared to the spectacular final hour, the first two hours seem uneventful and insignificant. However, to be fair, I feel that it's simply impossible to create two hours of film that could appropriately lead into the battle of Helm's Deep. It's difficult to comprehend how such scenes came to exist in the rather short amount of time Peter Jackson has had to create six hours (so far) of finished film. The battle of Helm's Deep is simply unreal; it's unlike any event that has come to pass since fantasy films gained, and regained, popularity.As assumed, The Two Towers begins where The Fellowship of the Ring ended. The majority of the film follows four separate groups and their story lines: Frodo and Sam; Aragorn and Legolas, Merry and Pippin, and Saruman and his army. The performances live well up to the standards of the first film, with a particularly notable performance from Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, whose role is significantly larger in The Two Towers. Aragorn satisfies a thirst for someone to root for, a thirst that was left partly unquenched in Fellowship. It's much easier to root for Aragorn than it is for Frodo; Aragorn has many more qualities of a leading man, a soldier, and a hero. More than once did the audience, filled mostly with academy voters, applaud the heroics of Aragorn. Gollum also shines in a much-welcomed large role, due to extremely realistic computer animation, and a fine performance from Andy Serkis, upon which the animation was modeled. In Fellowship, it was appropriate to consider Gollum one of the many great 'features' of the film. However, here he is more of a leading character and a 'star,' and his convincing dual-personality, stabbing voice, and well-choreographed body movements make him consistently eye-grabbing and the center of focus of nearly every scene in which he appears.As was The Fellowship of the Ring, The Two Towers is a visual delight. Those who have seen Fellowship are no doubt familiar with the beauty of the landscapes of New Zealand. The cinematography is, again, one of the best aspects of the film. The swooshing camera movements that follow the armies and horsemen throughout the fields are extremely satisfying in this post-Matrix era. The shots of the ascending enemy-laden ladders in the battle of Helm's Deep are terrifying and chillingly gorgeous all at once. The visual effects take an appropriate leap forward from those of the first film. While the visual effects in Fellowship were outstanding, the battle of Helm's Deep provides for the best application of CGI since the rippling waves of The Matrix's 'Bullet Time.' The battle of Helm's Deep features absolutely awe-inspiring and seamless integration of acting, stunts, and computer animation. Each orc seems to have its own personality, demonstrated in its movements and visual features. The masses of armies fight with strategy and true character, which I imagine is much harder to accomplish than animating thousands of identical clone troopers. The only problem I have with the visual department is the look of Gimli, the Treebeard. Gimli's visual features seem a bit childish and uninspired, inconsistent with the standards set by the rest of the film. But again, there is simply nothing that compares to the battle of Helm's Deep. George Lucas and the Wachowski brothers certainly have not created anything that approaches the grandness and magnificence of The Two Towers' final hour, and I doubt they will do so anytime soon.In The Fellowship of the Ring, I had a few minor problems with Howard Shore's score. While I thought it was gorgeous and it established several very memorable themes, I don't think it handled the sentimental scenes (opening in the Shire, Gandalf's passing) properly. I thought it caved in to the melodrama a bit too much, resembling the emotions from James Horner's Titanic. However, I believe that The Two Towers requires the type of score which Howard Shore accomplishes best: dark, continuous, and unrelenting, as demonstrated in Se7en and Silence of the Lambs. The theme used in many of the action scenes in Fellowship (low brass, six notes repeated with a rest in between) is much more present in The Two Towers, appropriately. A brand new theme is also unveiled, the theme for Rohan, a prominent kingdom in Middle Earth. Rohan's theme is played more often than any other melody in the film, underscoring most of the memorable and heroic scenes with great effect. Howard Shore undeniably exhibits his skills as an 'A-list' composer, and with a possible double Oscar nomination this year for The Two Towers and Gangs of New York, he could get propelled to the very top of the 'A-list,' right beside John Williams and Hans Zimmer in terms of demand.If not the picture itself, there should be a way to recognize and award the battle of Helm's Deep. The battle sequence alone represents successful filmmaking in its highest form. The choreography of the battle, the visual effects, the pacing, acting, cinematography, and music, all work together in perfection to achieve grand filmmaking which is as entertaining and enjoyable as film can be. For this very reason, no one, whether a fan of Fellowship or not, should miss The Two Towers.",positif
Great movie I really enjoyed watching and better than the first part,positif
"Really, I should probably let this film soak in a bit; I am, after all, on something of a ""post-viewing"" high right now. However, at this moment, my feeling remains the same from the first installment - this is the movie experience I've been waiting my whole life for. In case you haven't gathered, this movie is visually stunning, literally breathtaking. I mean that, some of the scenes in this film simply stopped my lungs in their tracks, shocked at the pure, enveloping beauty of the shot. Peter Jackson has a profound grasp of visual manipulation like few directors have ever had.The acting is, as always, superb. Kudos for hiring ""actors"" not ""stars""; ""Oscar-worthy"" over-acting could have threatened the realistic touch the film's remarkable cast supply. Specific mention goes to both John Rhys-Davies in his well enjoyed comic turn, and very largely to Andy Serkis, who was a major role in creating the most realistic and brilliantly well-performed CGI character I've ever seen (Gollum).For the most part, and as a fan of the books, I take no offense to the slight plot modifications. My understanding is that Tolkien himself realized that visual adaptation of LotR would require a somewhat different take on his work, and was apparently open to such minute changes. There are also a few tiny bits and pieces I was disappointed to see not make the final cut, however, I'm sure a future inevitable extended DVD will take care of those.In short, if you found the continual enjoyment I did with the first movie of LotR, this movie will in no way let you down. Not even for a minute.Highly recommended, 10/10.",positif
"The Two Towers can only be explained in one word, beautiful.  This film left me breathless.  I was hoping for a film that could stand in the same depths of the Fellowship of the Ring, and I must say that it has surpassed the film completely.  I will have a hard time watching the Fellowship and seeing the ending, knowing there is so much more waiting.Let's start with Gollum.  Gollum gave an astonishing performance.  The poor misunderstood beast, or the darkened soul creature whose cares are only based on the One Ring.  The performance given in CGI is at times very human. The facial expressions given could strangely give this character a personality as you would see in any great actor.  Gollum's voice is still haunting, even when the beast appears to be the loving guide to the dark gates of Mordor.  For these reasons and more, Gollum has become my favorite character in the film, replacing Legolas in the Fellowship.
On the other side of Middle Earth we see Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli.  I have to say that the dark times of this movie are at times overbearing, and saddening.  There is a perfect mix of humor in the film given by the characters Gimli, and Legolas, while still keeping the viewer in understanding that these are very darkened times.  Aragorn's performance is outstanding.  He has proven that he can be put on an A-List of actors, and deserves appraise for his performance.Gandalf ""the White"" in this film was a twist.  We remember the friendly Gandalf The Grey in the Fellowship being a kind elderly wizard.  Shouting off fireworks for the children of the shire, and smoking ""leaf"" as explained in the novel.  There are no cute scenes with the new White Wizard.  No fireworks, or pipes.  Just a Wizard that knows the daunting task ahead, and the quest seems to have taken hold of the great wizard.
Very dark are the times for Frodo, and Samwise.  Gollum seams to give Frodo hope, as the two ring bearers can associate the pains of the One Ring. Frodo gives an amazing performance this time around as well.  It seams that the Ring of power has taken hold of Frodo, and our hero is slipping.  But the surprise was aimed at Samwise.  Proving that Sam is the definition of a true best friend.  Even at times when it seems there is no hope for the troubled trio, it seams that Sam brings hope to the moment.  This is what keeps the Frodo's story this time around even more extraordinary, is the hope that is there, even when all odds point to despair.
Merry and Pippin's story is very odd initially.  The Ents in the story are very wise and newly troubled creatures from the amazing mind of Tolkien. This story goes back to cut scenes during the worries of the rest of Middle Earth, and gives us a feeling of hope, in the troubled times of Aragorn and the others.  The Ents were very well done CGI wise, but it was there personality that moved the audience.  They are curiously wise, and well spoken and give the impression of an elderly college Professor.  Their story is eventually given a wonderful opportunity, and for those of us who know the story, know that greatness is upon them.This movie honestly moved me further than I thought any film could.  I could see my face and the emotion I felt as I was watching this mammoth film. Peter Jackson has truly given us all a gift of a magnificent.  This story has captivated my heart, and the film has taken my breath away.  There is no words that can express the greatness of this film. 10/10",positif
"Watching this movie is like watching a 179 or 223 minutes long action sequence. The pace is incredibly high. Alright I have to admit that the Extended Edition of the ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" takes an awful lot of this pace away and make some of the scene's unnecessary long and the scene's with Treebeard are also a bit dull and long but still...Especially compared to the first that was just too slow at times this is an huge improvement!Luckily there also are some welcome additions in the Extended Edition. Best addition are the scene's with Boromir, Faramir and Denethor in Osgiliath.There also are some newly great characters and actors. David Wenham is a surprisingly talented young actor and I think it's great that they actually have cast someone that really looks like Sean Bean. Bernard Hill also impressed me, he probably is best know for his role as the captain in ""Titanic"" in which he also already impressed me. Viggo Mortensen probably still is the best actor of ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies. Yes sure Ian McKellen and Christopher Lee are also more than great but Mortensen really puts some passion and effort in his character. I know Sean Astin is always being praised a lot but I seriously don't think that he is such a good actor in any of ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies. Andy Serkis also was really good as Gollum/Sméagol and I wouldn't had mind seeing him get an Oscar nod.Strange thing is that the Gimli and Legolas suddenly changed into some comical sidekick characters. It was odd to see but it works! They provide some good comical relief at times.Most fantastic thing about the movie is that it's really action filled. The Battle of Helm's Deep truly is fantastic to see. Still favorite and most powerful moment of the movie is when the Ent's march to war. Also the scene's with the riders of Rohan are a true spectacle.I've never been really a big fan of the editing of ""The Lord of the Rings"" movies and this one is no exception. Problem is that Peter Jackson shot way too many hours of footage with as a result that the editors have difficulties picking the right scene's and the length of them.But ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"" is one of those movies were the pluses make more than up for the minuses.A spectacular adventure action experience.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",positif
"As you know Tolkien did a great job with creating the world. Also did a perfect job with writing the battles. Also It's not that easy to fitting that to the adaptation. The whole cast did pretty perfect job with The Two Towers. I know whole Trilogy made in same time. Only the film editors are changing through the trilogy. So they managed a great job making these movies.I think The Siege of Minas-Tirith sequence is also pretty good and flawless. But the horror and darkness is so effective in The Helm's Deep Battle. You may predict the Rohan People are going to win, they're the good guys after all. But even if you are watching this movie second time, you will feel that hopeless times again.The first half of the movie feels slow, I think that brings realistic style to a fantasy movie. Of course there is too important scenes in the first half of the movie, I'm saying the most important scenes are in the second half of the movies. This goes for all three movies.Tell me how can a movie achieve this much? Costume Design, Makeup, Art Direction & Set Decoration, Film Editing, VFX, SFX, Scores. The Trilogy manages to be revolutionary nearly all of that. At least it is Revolutionary in 5 of them. Some movies made me love some genres, The Lord of the Rings made me love the Cinema.",positif
"In the Two Towers (TT) we are re-united with most of our heroes from the Fellowship of the Ring (FotR). Split apart by betrayal, and a company of orcs, Frodo and Sam have begun the last leg of their quest to Mordor. Ant and Dec (sorry, Merry and Pippin) are prisoners of the orcs, pursued by Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli  a quest that brings the company, and the people of Rohan, closer to conflict.Opinion is divided about the second film. The entertainment junkies seem to think it's better than the first, largely on account of the Battle of Helms Deep, which is rather impressive. I thought it was a bit weaker, mainly because, in a wilderness adventure, there's more emphasis on the characters than in the spectacle of set piece action; and because the CGI is less subtle as a result.Once again, liberties are taken with the story. There's no riding of the Grey Company. There's a more obvious tension between Eowyn and Aragorn (Legolas has to remind Aragorn who he's dating), and (controversial among the Tolkienites) Faramir's character has been darkened somewhat. In fact, the directorial trait of adding more colour to the main characters while painting out the subtlety of the peripheral ones continues from FotR. Partly because we're introduced to more characters in TT, the overall effect leaves the film slightly two-dimensional. On balance I thought the treatment of Faramir to be less heinous than that of Denethor in Return of the King, but more on that later.The mood, though, remains pure Tolkien and that, more than anything, is the triumph of the movie. From the Beowulf-like set for Meduseld (Tolkien famously nicked his description of the seat of Rohan from the UK's first epic) to the majestic sweep of New Zealand, the film more than once reminded me of my own mental images of Tolkien's world. And, once again, I found myself interested in the story.So, to the flaws. I mentioned in an earlier review of FotR the astonishing heighism in Peter Jackson's adaptation. You can imagine Jackson scratching his head wondering what to do for laughs now that Ant and Dec have been nicked by Ugluk, Grishnakh and the lads. His solution is ingenious; find the next shortest member of the company. Gimli, therefore, shoulders the mantle of comedy relief. As a strapping man of 6'4'' I am allowed a certain disdainful disinterest to such a phenomenon; but it is worth noting. Also worth noticing is the astonishing transformation of Arwen from a feisty, most un-Tolkien lady in FotR to the submissive pre-Raphaelite stereotype of the books. I guess this is because Eowyn has turned up, but still. The Elves still speak like they're doped up, except the peculiarly immune elfin fancy boy, Legolas. On that note, was it really necessary for him to mount his horse that way? Or surf his way down a staircase at the battle of Helms Deep? Jim Horner should do an alternative Beach Boys theme for that scene.Anyway, these are minor points in a film that is, if not a major, then at least a minor, triumph. As mentioned by others, the film is worth seeing for Gollum alone. And I can think of many more reasons to see it. You could also check out the extended version, which is even better. 7/10.",positif
"Even if I watched this movie, like more than 20 times, still I feel nearly the same as I first watch.Can you imagine a movie can make you feel always the same. You're feeling that desperate, hopeless times with the Rohan soldiers.The first half of the movie is going slow, I think that brings realistic style to the movie, even if it is a Fantasy genre movie.As you may know, Tolkien is still the best at world creation on a Fantasy world. And he's too good at writing battle sequences. I don't know, the reason can be the World War that he fought in. He's making so remarkable battle sequences. And in the movie Peter Jackson and his crew did an amazing job with adaptation.The great cast that chosen well, shows you don't need big stars all the time.Howard Shore's brilliant Original Scores makes the movie much more effective.Cinematography is the most important thing when we're talking about visuals. The rainy night shots are just amazing. Academy Award winner Andrew Lesnie did really great job.The VFX and SFX is just magnificent, stunning quality.

"Seriously, I never thought a movie could get better than the Fellowship of the Ring, but it did. This movie should be #1 on the IMDb top 250. This movie, as long as it was, captivated me from start to finish, and those who are not entertained by this movie can not be entertained period.
Yes, I have read the book. Any chapters cut out at the end of books III and IV will probably themselves in the next installment. If you haven't noticed, the beginning of the Two Towers was actually closed the Fellowship of the Ring on the big screen.Gollum was a CG masterpiece. He added some light to this incredibly dark movie. At the same time, there are areas where you feel sorry for the poor guy, or just want to kill him. Smeagol was probably the most diverse character I've ever seen.Elijah Wood put on a better performance than he did in the first movie, as did Sean Astin. Ian McKellen, who captivated us in the last movie, captivated us even more in this one. Viggo Mortensen, John Rhys-Davies, and Orlando Bloom made a great trio. They laughed together, cried together, prospered together, and suffered together. This trio gave life to Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas. Eowyn expressed her emotions clearly through Miranda Otto. The music need not be discussed. Its greatness speaks for itself.Favorite Scene: The Battle of Helms Deep. Possibly the greatest scene in the book, 50% of the trailer, and action packed climax to this beautiful movie.
The movie, like its predecessor, fails to bring us closure, but that's ok. Closure will come next year.

I have to say this film starting with the fellowship was incredibly well made. I know Titanic received 11 awards but I think this whole trilogy should receive 15. This intro to the trilogy was extremely in depth and even had the best prologue ever. I enjoy being introduced to the characters and thier origins and learning about the history of the one ring and how it does evil upon middle earth even after Sauron's death. Be patient with the action as is picks up as the trilogy's story unfolds. It all depends on what you see movies for. But this whole trilogy has quite a bit of everything. That alone surpasses all movies.10/10 (actually more than that),positif
"I do love all three films of The Lord of the Rings trilogy, all are visually stunning with wonderful music and strong narratives. The Two Towers is my personal favourite of the three for several reasons. For one thing it is less talky than Fellowship of the Ring, and the pace is a little more secure here. Also the final battle is just breathtaking in the action, direction and in its scope, and very compelling and epic. And some of the characters are developed more here than they were in Fellowship of the Ring primarily Frodo and Aragorn, who were played very well there but a little bland in comparison to here. When it comes to the scope The Two Towers is possibly the biggest in the trilogy. The cinematography is one of the strongest assets, while the scenery, costumes, lighting and make up(the orcs look amazing) are all gorgeous. You can tell a lot of effort went into this and it showed. The music is also darker and perhaps more complex, the story is richer and compelling and the dialogue is thought provoking. People may disagree, but I think The Two Towers is the best directed of the trilogy too.The acting is very good. Elijah Wood is likable enough with a stronger-written character, while Sean Astin's bumbling persona suits Sam really well. Viggo Mortensson is as strong and charismatic as ever. Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee and Bernard Hill are also perfectly cast, but the real revelation in my view with this movie is Gollum. Here Gollum is designed superbly, and Andy Serkis's performance is absolutely phenomenal and Oscar-nod worthy.In conclusion, a fine film and for me my personal favourite of the trilogy. 10/10 Bethany Cox",positif
"For this movie, Peter Jackson was faced with a challenge: how to make a great stand-alone film when the beginning and ending are in separate movies? He did a magnificent job. Like the first one, this movie starts with a slam-bang battle; however, where the first film had armies, this film has a clash between two titans.From there, the movie builds to the enormous set-piece siege. And, along the way, we meet one of the most interesting characters of this, or any movie: Gollum, the complex, torn, schitzophrenic slave to the will of the One Ring.And, even more than the first film, the Ring is also a character: the viewer can see it wearing down Frodo, pushing him to the limit, tempting those around him. The encounter at Osgiliath, while not in the book, is a fascinating visual realization of more subtle themes in the book. I know that, when I walked out of the theatre, I knew that there was only one movie I was looking forward to during the next year, and that was Return of the King.",positif
"I considered The Fellowship of the Ring to be one of the greatest movies ever. This one is better!The scenery is marvelous, the animations great, and the story superb. This episode strays further from the books when it comes to the unfolding of events, but I feel that it stays closer in atmosphere and realism; the nazgûls are now the fear-inspiring creatures they should be. Gollum, excellently implemented, even becomes more realistic then I remember him from the books, not to mention other attempts to portray him. His schizophrenic monologues are among the highlights of the movie.The major drawback is once again the apparent incapability of the dark-side creatures. Aragorn with fellows can ride back and forth among them unhurt, while the Uruk-Hai fall in large numbers just for being nearby. Though I enjoy many of the jokes made at Gimli's expense, this still is another thing I partly dislike. Gimli sure is no clown in the books.I rate the movie 9/10 (my highest so far).",positif

After fleeing from an evil band of orcs, another pair of Hobbits sit with stalks, of an Ent known as Treebeard, who gets annoyed when friends are sheared, summons brethren, and against the foe they walk. Helm's Deep provides the backdrop for a battle, where sabres, swords and axes are all rattled, but walls come tumbling down, as the Uruk-hai hit town, when their hoards stampede and charge like crazy cattle.",positif
"Vote: 8.8 (rounded up to 9)The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers is an amazing movie that any Tolkien fan, adventure fan, or war fan should see. Acting: Elijah Wood as Frodo is amazing. He really captures the pain that the poor little hobbit must be going through. Ian McKellen as Gandalf is excellent,even though he has a much smaller role than in FOTR. Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn was another good choice and you could really experience what he must be going through. John Rys-Davies was really good as Gimli, but his jokes got really tiring before the end. Sean Astin as Sam fit the description of good old Sam well and also acted out the character perfectly. Bernard Hill as Theoden, Brad Dourif as Grima, Miranda Otto as Eowyn, Karl Urban as Eomer, David Wenham as Faramir and Liv Tyler as Arwen were all excellent actors. Gollum was really amazing. Andy Serkis deserves some award, for the perfect cat coughing up fur ball voice for Gollum, and kudos to the design team who made the motion capture suit. I wish we could have seen more of Christopher Lee as he is a superb actor. Orlando Bloom as Legolas, on the other hand, sucked. He had absolutely no emotion and if it wasn't for his fighting scenes then the character would have been totally wasted. Dominic Monaghan as Merry and Billy Boyd as Pippin were also good actors. Directing: Peter Jackson did another excellent job in this movie, though as i said in my FOTR review, his career as a horror movie maker hurt him. The scene where all the dead Orc bodies were piled up and one of their heads was on a pole wasn't really necessary (and then Gimli was going through the burning remains (hmmmm orc barbecue), and there was another stupid scene were you saw the Uruks being born out of mud sacs. Screenplay: Good, the only scene they needed was the one in the extended edition of the flashback between Faramir, Boromir and Denethor. That scene was really necessary to describe Faramirs character Special Effects: Too amazing for words. The Battle of Helms Deep was so perfect you couldn't tell what was CGI and what wasn't. Gollum didn't look like a fake. The battle of Isengard was also well done and when the ents broke the dam and Isengard was flooded i was reminded of a disaster flick. The special effects alone were worth the price of admission. Other: Again the cinematography was beautiful and just jaw-dropping gorgeous. Makes me really want to visit New Zealand just to see the places they filmed. Rohan, and Edoras especially were beautiful. Howard Shore's score was excellent. The Rohan theme song fit the beautiful scenery perfectly. Overall: An excellent movie worth seeing. If the filmmakers weren't so stuck up about themselves this movie would be even better.",positif
"My wife did, and she was the one who dragged me to this thing against my wishes. Ok, I'm admittedly not a fantasy fan, and I'm probably the only person back in my high school in the 70's that didn't have any desire to read the novels, and still haven't to this day. With that said, the special effects were brilliant, and the cinematography superior. But for the life of me, I cannot understand the affection for the main Hobbit characters, they're boring, boring and more boring. The only thing I found entertaining besides the effects was Smeagol, or whatever its name is, that thing stole the show. I was also forced to see the first movie, and I thought that one would never end. Ditto for this one. Can hardly wait for the next one in a couple of years. Then again, I'm still waiting for a sequel to Killer Clowns from Outer Space.",positif
"Thor: Love and Thunder does attempt to explore themes of love and loss whilst introducing the Mighty Thor and putting Thor on a journey of self discovery. However, it sadly doesn't work as well as it should due to a rushed pace and way too many jokes that are almost never funny.Chris Hemsworth is still going strong as Thor but the extreme goofiness is getting a little stale. Natalie Portman has never been better as this character and Tessa Thompson is still great as Valkyrie, even though she doesn't really get much to do.Taika Waititi massively overstays his welcome as Korg this time, who becomes very annoying really fast. Christian Bale is one of the better MCU villains with a good motivation and an unsettling presence but is let down by limited screen time.Takia's direction on the other hand is stronger, there's some nice visual imagery and the colour palette is pretty vibrant but the MCU grey is still present throughout sadly. The CG is consistently inconsistent from start to finish.The music by Michael Giacchino is fine, there's one new theme that's pretty memorable but the lack of Thor's theme is annoying. The soundtrack is really good, all the songs are classics that fit the tone and style well but some could have been used better.",positif
"While not the worst Marvel film, it is certainly not worthy of high praise. Ragnarok was a masterpiece but Taika falls incredibly short of expectations for a bar that was set high in the beginning phases of the MCU. I didn't hate this movie, but I didn't love it, and that is a trend with some of their recent offerings. I'm on the fence about a rating of 7, but my favorite MCU movies are in the 8-10 range.Characters:
Thor has been reduced to a joke and doesn't have the appeal he once had. Why does he look like a carnie ala Joe Dirt? Why is he so weak, dumb and needy?Valkayrie's character has been reduced to a lesser version of her former self and her rule of New Asgard was pitiful and lacked inspiration. Tessa's talent was totally wasted.Christian Bale's performance, while exceptional was a bit too Voldemort-esque.The appearance of the Guardians was lame -who would look up to Starlord? Chris Pratt came across as a white trash version of the character first introduced and has completely lost his likability. Rocket is the best character in the Guardians and he barely had any lines.The first battle was against hawklike chicken muppets riding Star Wars knockoff vehicles and they just weren't formidable in the least.The cameos were fun (Hella) and the goats were annoying when they didn't have to be.Music:
The use of music was ill-timed and not matched to the action -no offense to GNR, but why so much of their music? November Rain was the only song that seemed to be paired well with the action. There are so many 80's rock and metal songs that would have made a better fit .Plot:
Boring and drawn-out. Pay no attention to the commenters whining about ""wokeness"" and this has nothing to do with anything other than their own prejudice and intolerance. The humor was dumb, childish and just not that funny or witty, unless maybe you are a 8 year old boy raised by immature parents.I'm a huge Marvel fan but I have been so disappointed in recent offerings that are a result of Disney greed, poor writing and lazy directing.",positif
"Don't get me wrong I loved parts of the movie but some parts of it felt a bit rushed it seems like now 2 hours is a bit short for Marvel to tell the story fans the movie should of been atleast another half
An hour because there could of been scenes to make to movie better like Scenes with Christian Bales Gorr the God Butcher killing 1 or 2 more over gods and other worlds would of made him a lot more menacing and it was so much potential there with the actor he is he did well with what hes had but the run time of the movie felt to short it done that with Doctor strange MoM now Thor love it but give us a longer movies in future 2 hour Marvel films are to short to tell a full on story.",positif
"It is a decent movie, but it focus much on comic reliefs. Christian Bale is under utilized, Gorr should have given more screen time and the back story would make it a better relief.",positif
"It's like no Marvel movie before. It is most likely going to upset many hardcore fans of the MCU. If you accept the theme however, you will find something very fresh. If you're tired of every Marvel movie being the same and you like the idiosyncratic style of Waititi, you will enjoy it. If you are a fan of the more traditional superhero movies, this one will probably make you furious at times.",positif
"Marvel have going downgrade lately. Quantity Over quality? Thats facts. This movie have a potential to be the coolest and amazing thor movie. But turns out its just another overhyped movie with mediocre story. I know this movie just build up for greater upcoming story. But why? Sacrificing a movie with great potential just to make another mediocre movie? Im afraid mcu have gone too far. U can see the quality since iron man 1 and endgame. After that? Nothing. Thor L&T have unstable CGI, Forced Joke, And lacks of depth on storytelling. I can't believe this movie have many plot hole. Like who know heimdall have son? Who know that thor ca lend his power for limited time or forever? Who know what happen to gorr before his daughter died? Or what happen to his race and wife? Why gorr only ask his daughter but not wife to eternity. Or maybe ask his whole race to be resurrected? Or maybe thats not how its worked? Whole MCU Phase 4 is nothing but A ""LOVE"" Story. Almost every movie they put in Phase 4 the main story of the movie is about love and regrets. I wanna know more about gorr backstory but i guess it will never happen eh? Or maybe someday his daughter will tell the story. And i want to know necrosword origin? They dont even tell us about that, just straight to gorr mighty sword to kill gods. Im worried that marvel have run out of ideas for their movies. Like the story for this movie its just not it. Now we come to post credit part. First post credit scene? Zeus told His son ""Hercules"" to kill thor odinson. Which im pretty sure we gonna wait another 5-6 Years just to see him again in theatre. Anyway Welcome to MCU Brett Goldstein (Hercules). Second post credit? Jane in valhalla and met heimdall. If im being honest they should leave this valhalla thing alone. Let the one who died just died. Shouldnt show us they physically alive in valhalla because its just ruined the emotional moment we get from the dead of asgardian. Is Thor L&T Good Movie? No.Is Thor L&T A Bad Movie? No.Is This movie better than recent Mcu movies? Idk
Because they all look the same.Peak performance for christian bale gorr
and natalie portman jane foster. Top Notch performance for both of them.",positif
"Got to see this at the UK premier last night and have to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. The narrative reminded me of a fairy tale and the way stories are passed from generation to generation, while Ragnarok is still my favourite Thor movie cudos to Marvel Studios for giving Taika Waititi the chance to make a super hero movie for kids of all ages.Oh and make sure to stay for the mid and end credit scenes both are awesome.",positif
"Very little naked woman sceenes,thor kitchen my g is huge only cas cgi. Best characters are two goats that are carrying thors ship spoiler alert. Zeus was great but he is fat.",positif
"It cannot top Thor Ragnarok but it was really enjoyable! Compared to the first two Thor movies this is such an improvement. The only thing that could have been better was the plot. The story was pretty simple and focused on the comedy, which is not that bad, it just could've been a lot better.",positif
"Expect laughs, heart, and creativity, but don't expect a Ragnorak level movie.Unfortunately Thor: Love and Thunder can't be as good as Ragnorak simply because of when it's being released. Thor: Love and Thunder is the first Thor movie in what is essentially the new 'phase 1' of Marvel. There is a lot that needs to be set up and unfortunately Thor: Love and Thunder has to do it's part in setting up that greater story.All in all, it's an entertaining, well executed, movie that I walked out of in a good mood. Given what it has to accomplish in the overall Marvel narrative, I'd say that's an accomplishment. And with the ending that it has, I'm very excited to see what is set up in this movie payoff.",positif
I was not hyped for this movie because I didn't liked the trailer itself. This movie didn't gave me goosebumps like ragnarok. It was not that good but ok. I didn't expected much from this film. Villain was not much impactful like it was in Thor ragnarok. It was ok according to me. Depends upon you to watch it or not.,positif
"A casual MCU fan would find Thor: Love and Thunder to be more than enjoyable, arguably having the most character development in any solo Marvel Project. I would assume the vast majority of fans would rank this film better than Dr Strange: Multiverse of Madness but worse than Spider-Man No Way home. It does not live up to the standard of the last Thor movie but sides as one of the better MCU films. Waititi 's iconic humor does not disappoint in this film and is filled with top notch action scenes; Bale's depiction of Gorr the god butcher is impeccable; However the film fails to move the MCU's broader narrative forward and leaves fan asking did this film have any impact on anything and anyone.",positif
"Overall a good movie, brilliantly directed by Taika, manages to seamlessly move back and forth between hilarious comedy and dark moments. However it falls apart a bit towards the end as the ending was quite rushed, making the film feel like 10 minutes too short. Also No Way Home's multiverse exploration has skyrocketed everyone's expectations and we kinda want to see something about the multiverse in every Marvel movie now and when that doesn't happen its a bit disappointing. Apart from that this movie is good fun!",positif
"Thor: Love and Thunder! 9/10.The length of the movie doesn't make it a bad movie, sure it feels
pretty short but the story is still pretty good. The villain (Gorr The God
Butcher) was pretty terrifying, a very good actor and a very good
villain. The movie is one of the best in Phase 4 yet,
""is it better than
Doctor Strange MOM?"" My opinion is.... yes. The movie is just amazing
with Taika Waititi killin' it again, the movie was comedy, action, horror,
and sad which is just perfect for a movie, specially for an MCU movie.Now for the spoiler part:
Gorr is pretty horrifying, specially when he scares the living crap out of
the kids when he literally snapped an ""animal's?"" head. We also got
Heimdall's son in the movie and I think he would play a bigger part in
the future of the MCU. Heimdall appeared in the second post-credit
scene in Valhalla with Jane Foster/The Mighty Thor who sadly died in
the end, The Zeus part was pretty funny, Thor's butt was shown in
the scene which was pretty funny I guess and the fight scene in
Zeus' ""temple?"" was very cool with the VFX. Thor's got a daughter!Yay, Mjölnir is now back with Thor and the Stormbreaker was given to
the daughter. Stormbreaker got a little jealous on Mjölnir. Zeus was
thought dead after Thor threw the Zeusbolt to his chest but in the mid.Credits scene, Zeus was alive and Hercules was revealed! And that's
my review, I really enjoyed this movie and I'm looking forward to see.",positif
"I just watched it at a cinema and its a great movie worth to watch the only. Critic i got is to much COMEDY.

"Thor 4 is going to cause quite a bit of division, with some people loving the fast pacing and humour, and others citing a lack of character development with a flippant disregard of true, life-threatening danger.In a way, they'll both be right.There will also be a never-ending comparison to Thor: Ragnarok, with some justification, as TR was Taika's first foray into the MCU and therefore a breath of fresh air; but also with the same reasoning being a caveat that we are a bit inured to Taika's originality now, and thus not as easily impressed.While I agree that the director's penchant for not wasting time on minutiae allows the story to proceed apace, it felt as though the middle of the film failed to allow the antagonist to establish his bonafides as a true threat, reduced as he was to scaring children. Without going into specifics, the ending also nullified his emotional motivation that ""All gods must die.""However, the film makes up for some of these weaker points with imaginative use of powers, props and locations. But you aren't allowed a moment to digest the more serous moments, and end up leaving the cinema feeling a bit confused and uncertain as to whether you enjoyed what you just watched. Hence the division of opinion of those who watched the film, but didn't take more time to digest what they saw.So when you do see it, give yourself a few hours to let it soak in, then decide if you feel it was worthy of your time & money.",positif
"I liked this movie and I think it's a fine addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It has the distinct directorial style of Sam Raimi with some quirky camera choices, horror elements and quick montages. The fight scenes and magic are more creative than in previous films, such as the musical battle. The visual design of the universes are very distinct and feels like other worlds have really come to life. It was very exciting to explore other worlds and other versions of Dr. Strange. Scarlet Witch has a truly terrifying presence.While I enjoyed the movie overall, it did disappoint some expectations and could have been better. As my review title states, it's more like Wandavision 2 than Doctor Strange 2. I kept wondering, whose movie is it? Elizabeth Olsen steals the show as Wanda, a corrupted demonic figure who fits the ""slasher"" role in this film, but her characterisation was also a bit too single-minded to feel like a real person.The pacing is very strange. It often skips about from one scene to another before they have really been explored or digested, leaving us with only a glimpse. This film feels like the characters are abruptly jumping between several films that have been awkwardly smashed together, unlike the first Doctor Strange film which was extremely focused. Cool scenes like the Illuminati were wasted by being disposed of so quickly. The multiverse isn't really explored beyond red and green being swapped and pizza balls being ""free"".The writing leaves a lot to be desired. As mentioned, this is essentially Wanda's story so nobody else is given much to work with. America Chavez is just there to run away from things, Christine Palmer is just there to give Dr. Strange something to anguish over and Wong is just there for the special effects. There are glimmers of character development but it goes nowhere. We keep seeing that Dr. Strange and Christine Palmer don't work out in any universe, which we already knew, but they keep repeating it for some reason, and it's not a compelling character relationship. Dr. Strange realises that he's really no different from the other versions of him, so he has to accept what he's got in this universe and not pine for things that are out of reach (i.e. Finding happiness without Christine). But he also realises that he can choose to be different from the other versions of him and work for the greater good without throwing anyone under the bus (i.e. Letting America Chavez keep her powers). Which one is it? What does he learn from the other versions of him?On a finer level, the dialogue had lots of problems. It was often very cheesy, like the supposedly inspiring speech Dr. Strange gives to America Chavez near the end. It was also full of blunt exposition, like the encyclopedic infodumps about multiversal powers, the Darkhold, the Vishanti, the Illuminati, Thanos and so on. There are times when it felt like the writing room had an extensive Q&A session where they tried to cover every possible viewer doubt, concern or plot hole, but instead of weaving the details in naturally, they just made the characters parrot their explanations verbatim, which sounded contrived and awkward. For example, there was one scene where the film stops so that Wong can ask Wanda point-blank why she wants full multiversal powers instead of just staying in one universe with her family. This happens a lot during the film.The writer Michael Waldron was chosen because of his experience with multiverse stories, especially Loki. This sounds great until you realise that Waldron has already run out of ideas and just wrote the same story again:Main tension: The powerful protagonist is put in cuffs and deprived of his powers (Loki: Loki; Dr. Strange: Stephen Strange).He is brought before a powerful tribunal of celebrity cameos with AI assistants to account for crimes against the natural order. Protagonist responds with snarky remarks (Loki: TVA, Owen Wilson and Miss Minutes; Dr. Strange: Illuminati, Patrick Stewart and Ultron robots).The tribunal has some heroic story for the public, but they are hiding a sinister secret (Loki: Time Keepers maintain the Sacred Timeline; Dr. Strange: Strange sacrificed himself to defeat Thanos).Due to having no powers, the protagonist resorts to hand-to-hand combat in their headquarters (Loki: Loki & Sylvia vs. TVA; Dr. Strange: Stephen Strange vs. Illuminati Mordo).They turn out to be staffed by imbeciles who couldn't catch a shoplifter. They are dispatched easily in combat so the plot can continue (Loki: TVA vs. Anyone else; Dr. Strange: Illuminati vs. Wanda).Main plot: A female character is being pursued because she has powerful abilities to transport herself across time and space and keeps evading everyone (Loki: Sylvie with orange portals; Dr. Strange: America Chavez with blue portals).Main threat: A female character possesses the minds of other people to attack (Loki: Sylvie's enchantments; Dr. Strange: Wanda's dreamwalking).Lazy and blunt exposition technique: Protagonist uses a machine to bring his memories to life (Loki: TVA timeline viewer; Dr. Strange: Shop display that projects your past trauma to the whole street).Lazy and blunt character development: Protagonist is forced to encounter an alternate version of a significant female character from his life to make him realise something about himself. She otherwise serves no story purpose (Loki: Simulation of Lady Sif; Dr. Strange: Illuminati Christine Palmer).Eventually, protagonist finds a deranged man who lives alone inside a castle in a post-apocalyptic realm. He knows more about the vaguely defined dangers of the multiverse and must be dispatched (Loki: He Who Remains; Dr. Strange: Sinister Strange).If Disney keeps hiring Waldron to write the same story, I'll save you ticket expenses by explaining the next Spider-Man movie. Tom Holland's Peter Parker encounters a universe-hopping Spider-Woman and tries to pursue her to find her secrets. He is captured by the multiversal Peter Parker Posse headed by Tobey Maguire and injected with a serum that neutralises his spider-powers. The film stops so that Maguire can give a half hour lecture about the finer details of the multiverse and how there can only be one Spider-Man per universe otherwise something vaguely bad happens. Spider-Woman arrives and controls the minds of some Peter Parkers and defeats them all in half a minute. Using a memory display machine, she reveals that the Peter Parker Posse isn't protecting the multiverse, they're secretly neutralising all the Spider-People's powers so their loved ones won't be in danger anymore. Spider-Woman turns out to be an alternate Aunt May, making Tom Holland's Spider-Man somehow realise that with great power comes great responsibility. They trace the neutralising serum to the Final Peter Parker, who lives in a universe where every single person got spider powers and misused them, leaving him as the only survivor. His life's mission is now to ensure that nobody ever gets spider powers and claims that ""with NO power comes NO responsibility!"" They defeat him and travel back to all the other universes with radioactive spiders to restore a Spider-Person in each of them. The end. Rinse and repeat for the next ten years.",positif
"The overall pacing is relentless and the sequel shows its hand a lot earlier than you'd expect. There's been endless speculation from fans about the villain, which i won't spoil here, but it's revealed surprisingly quickly.You can't help that feel somewhere in the multiverse, there's a better version of this movie that exists.",positif
"Sam Raimi definitely put a splash of horror in this action film. Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness is darker & more violent than any previous MCU movie, which could be considered a strength. However, I felt like there was not enough multiverse and maybe too much madness. Despite the entertaining visuals, the plot is fairly chaotic, and the acting & dialogue are inconsistent. This movie is an entertaining ride, but it's a little too messy to stand on its own.",positif
"Xochitl Gomez shows up from an alternate reality and asks for Benedict Cumberbatch's help. She can travel between the various realities, but she has no control over it; when she's in a life-threatening situation, she autonomically zips into a a different world. She's been doing that a lot, since monsters have been attacking her to steal her ability. This is at least the second Dr. Strange she's asked for help -- here's the corpse of another.For reasons of the plot, Cumberbatch goes to Elizabeth Olsen, aka The Scarlet Witch for help. Waddaya know, she's been controlling the demons because she wants to get to an alternate world where she has children -- thus linking into the Disney+ show, Wandavision.Sam Raimi is back directing, and he borrows liberally, not only from earlier superhero movies, but from horror movies. This one has fewer quips than your average Marvel movie, but it does ask questions both overtly ""Are you happy?"" and symbolically. It's not my principal interest, but at a tad over two hours, my bladder didn't force me out of the theater.",positif
"The first Dr. Strange stands in its own, even for just superhero movies. But this one is still enjoyable, especially if you are caught up with WandaVision and Loki.I don't understand the unreasonable level of hate for anything post-endgame other than Spider-Man (shocker). Sure there's a couple things people have pointed out that I've noticed but the movie is nowhere near the suck-fest rabid fanboys insist it is. It's a fairly standard comic-book fare.I'm not going to convince anyone this is the best MCU movie, I don't even think it is. But it's good and it's fun. Some Marvel fans are weird now, they have no ability to have any nuance in their opinion.",positif
"I was not in a good head space at all watching it the first time, so I had to watch it a second time.My number one worry going into this film was that it wouldn't be a Stephen Strange film but a Wanda film. I was half right.Spoiler alert: She is the main baddie. And she kills many people to try and suck the power out of America Chavez in order to ""dream walk"", the act of going into a variant of oneself and taking over their body. She has been corrupted by an evil book and has found out there are variants of her children in the multiverse and she wants them for herself. I kind of felt like her story was already told in WandaVision, and this also feels like a season finale of that.The exposition, which there is a lot of, is not as bad as I've seen in other movies. But because there is so much ""madness"" going with Wanda chasing Chavez through the multiverse, the script doesn't allow that much space to breathe.There are some strong moments in the film involving Strange meeting his other selves, or talking with a variant of Christine, and being confronted with his own ego and arrogance. But sadly, they are very fleeting. And that's a huge problem. My favorite scenes in the MCU have always involved dialogues about morality, grief, mortality and other strong themes. Ex: The balcony scene in the first Doctor Strange + the Sokovia Accords debate in Captain America Civil War.The movie's themes are primarily about people wanting what they can't have. While this wasn't the sequel I was truly hoping for, it is what we have. It's what I like to call ""the saggy middle"": not quite up to par with its predecessors but entertaining and important nonetheless.",positif
"Man, what a disappointment, expected way more interesting plot as Strange is one of the coolest and most powerful characters - at least so far it seemed, as Wanda just mopped the floor with him and kinda everybody. She is waaaay more overpowered than supposed to and her motive as a main villain? Being with her children in another universe... Rather unoriginal, kinda we got that in Wandavision. The sensation hunting with other universe's characters were not used well or interestingly whatsoever, while that america chavez girl is just a terrible actor with zero chemistry with the stars. Just a weak story, badly used characters, way too much nonsensical ""fight"", was a missed opp, really hoped marvel can still be on that level than before Endgame, however seems Spiderman was the last big hit that was spot on. Thor is the last hope, the rest is seemingly ruined or much lower quality than the predecessors.",positif
"Most of the reviews i see dictate the movie a 6/10 saying there wasn't enough doctor strange or the movie was chaotic. This is my first review for marvel as I've only really liked 3 of their movies, but i feel this movie is really good and deserves a higher rating. I honestly think its receiving a low rating because it diverted from marvels generic direction. There was gore every marvel movie misses. Not much else to say, its one of their top tier movies, I mean madness is in the name and people believe the story too crazy?Save for the ending, that was pretty generic for marvel.",positif
"Hats off to Sam Raimi for a fantastic return to superhero films. That doesn't help the films weakest link, it's story.The biggest problem with this film story is it McGuffin. To begin with, Marvel broke their rule that the TV shows shouldn't influence or interfere with the films. Wanda is looking for her kids, makes perfect sense for anyone who has seen WandaVision. If you haven't seen it, because you don't subscribe to Disney+, simple choose not to see it or whatever reason a person has, it makes no sense. If the plot had revolved around her trying to find another Vision, it would of more understanding to the larger audience, as that was her biggest loss in the films. The reveal of the kids could of still worked. Unfortunately the Marvel films following EndGame have fallen foul of poor writing, plot elements or both.",positif
"While this film has a more grim tone than its predecessors it's still a Marvel film at heart. Of course it would take Sam Raimi to find the perfect blend of comic-book-movie, horror, fantasy and slapstick. He might be working with a massive budget now, but the man stays true to his roots and sticking with what he knows pays off.The pacing may seem disjointed or fragmented at times, but I feel that only reflects the complex nature of the multiverse within the film. Maybe it's not like other groundbreaking MCU films, but ultimately this is an entertaining feature.",positif
"So thanks to watching some early reviews on YouTube saying this is more of a Doctor Strange and Wanda movie than a Multiverse movie, I adjusted my expectations and I enjoyed the movie thoroughly.And you might say, ""well it's literally called Multiverse of Madness, how do you expect me not to expect a Multiverse from this movie"", which I agree with. I had the same expectation when I first heard about the name of the movie and saw the trailers. But trust me, the whole thing revolves around the Multiverse And there is a lot of Madness, but not in a way you're thinking of. Naming this movie Multiverse of Madness was a real double-edged sword and it really shows, by how people reacted to it.First of all, I gotta say that this is probably the most different and unique movie of MCU, at least in the aesthetic department, or should I say the most different-looking. And you already know it's exactly because of Sam Raimi and the horror and creepy aspect he introduces in this movie. And I loved it!About the runtime, I remember seeing people argue that 2 hours is not actually bad and Sam Raimi movies are always more or less 2 hours and we are the unreasonable ones to think 2 hours. And I and many others thought ""well how is a movie about the multiverse is gonna be only 2 hours? We need at least 3 hours"". Which weren't wrong, because after watching the movie I can say that it definitely needed at least 20 more minutes. The pacing is really on and off, it kinda lingers in some scenes and it fast-forwards in some scenes that needed more time, especially the ending. I think they just need to hire better writers because once again, this didn't ""feel"" a movie, it felt like an episode and a teaser to the real thing, but I still really enjoyed it and had fun with it.And it is really weird too because the last movie they released was literally 2:28 hours and they've already seen that the longer runtime still sells like Infinity War and the 3-hour Endgame which are like in the top 5 of all time sellers in BoxOffice. I don't know why they cut scenes or why they didn't let some scenes linger more. Was it because of the writing? Then why not hire better writers or a team of writers like Markus and McFeely who knew what they were doing and gave us 4 decently written movies? I hope now that they're delving into the multiverse stuff, they actually get more creative writers and work on the script a lot more before releasing the movie.It would be interesting to see a director's cut of the movie or even a Scott Derrickson version where he actually continued the first movie and not mainly WandaVision (which is an understandable problem people have with this), but we'll never see just like we'll never see Edgar Wright's Ant-Man. If I were in Feige's, I'd just go crazy with every movie and give 100% freedom to directors to make whatever tf they want and go nuts with it and have a different MCU next to the main one. And even now is the best time to do it, why not let Edgar Wright make an Ant-Man movie and call it something like What If Ant-Man...? This is the perfect opportunity for them to go crazy with the multiverse stuff, but I guess making movies is hard and expensive, but I doubt these movies won't sell. Just give directors full control and hire better writers and writing teams and the word of mouth and the good reviews do the rest, just like Everything Everywhere All at Once.For people that are concerned about cameos and think this is gonna be a cameo galore and fanservice, don't worry. The cameos are fairly short, they are great and serve the plot, and are not just there just to be there, and they have some of the most brutal scenes I've seen from MCU. There was one particular scene that you know when you see it, that trod the line between PG-13 and R, and was so brutal that if you showed me the clip of it without context and without telling me anything, I would assume it was a scene from The Boys season 3. Yeah, that level of brutality!Danny Elfman did the score and it fit the movie and the gothic vibe beautifully and there was a certain battle that I'm not gonna even hint at, but you'll know when you watch the movie, that was just audio-visual delight. I am a little disappointed and sad that they didn't use the amazing Doctor Strange theme Michael Giacchino did, and I think he would've done an amazing job if they kept him, but I guess Danny is Sam's blue-eyed boy. But the score is still good, just wish his iconic theme was used more in this movie.The visuals were amazing too, although it still had some that looked really bad, and it seems like Marvel has been lacking with CGI in this phase more than before, even in the tv shows.But the thing about the visuals is that even though they are great and a joy to witness, I kinda miss the reality-bending we got in the first movie and No Way Home, I wish they used it here too and went crazier with it.And as for the direction, I gotta say it's pretty good and it's obvious Sam Raimi directed it as it has his fingerprint all over this movie and I loved it. It seems like Marvel is getting a little more open to having visionary directors take the helm and give them freedom. It's obvious that this movie is not given to Sam with 100 percent freedom, but I think they're getting a little bit better and I hope this freedom becomes bigger in the next projects. Sam Raimi does a great job with all the creepy, horror scenes, and the jump scares and this movie is more about witchcraft than it is about wizardry and spells. I really hope they keep doing these different genres and don't just stick to action-comedy as they've been for a long time. It's a breath of a fresh air seeing this being a different kind of superhero movie.I also really liked that he actually used a good color grading and that the colors and environments are alive and that they don't look like another bland Marvel movie.I don't think I need to talk about the acting because you already know they all do an amazing job. But surprisingly Wanda is the star of this movie and some people have a problem with that? I get that it's called Doctor Strange and this movie kinda lets Wanda outshine him, but did you also have a problem with Infinity War being more of a Thanos movie, or The Dark Knight is more of a Joker movie? I don't get that people say Doctor Strange had less things to do or even less cool things to do than Infinity War, because it felt to me that they both had more of or the same amount of screen-time and Doctor Strange had obviously more screen time.And America Chavez is a really interesting and a great addition to the MCU and Xochitl Gomez did a good job of portraying her.Some reviews said that Christine Palmer was again underutilized, which I guess? But I don't know what more they could've done with the fast pacing of this movie and I thought they did a decent job with Palmer anyway. Obviously, and as I said before, this movie could've benefited from some breathers and 20 extra minutes, but it was still fine.We also get Ashley Williams of course! And Bruce Campbell is great as ever. You can't have a Sam Raimi movie without Ash!I also heard some people say that they liked the first one better, which it's ok I guess? You could argue that the pacing of the first movie was better and Stephen Strange had a good development in there, but since the villain sucked in that movie, I cannot say that the first one is better. The villain and ""their"" motivation in this movie were far better in this movie, and I guess they had some movies and shows to get more development and it's kinda unfair to compare and say this one had more development because duh. But even if this was their first appearance, they still had a better motivation and were a better character anyway. (I'm using ""they"" to not spoil who the villain is but I think it's obvious for anyone who that is)In conclusion, this movie might not be what you think is going to be, so manage your expectations. The acting is great, the direction and Sam Raimi's touch are great and so is the cinematography, the music is good but disappointingly there is little to no use of Doctor Strange's iconic theme, the villain is good, the visuals are great but it needed more visuals and reality-bending from the first one, the horror aspect is fine and gives a fresh look to the MCU, but it's ultimately rushed, the pacing needed some work and needed extra time. I also forgot to say that there are some loose ends left from the first movie that they didn't deal with for some reason and it's not really a continuation of Doctor Strange as it is more a continuation of WandaVision, and in that case, people are kinda right if they think this wasn't that much of a Doctor Strange movie and more Wanda's.Maybe I'm just a little carried away and I'm giving it an 8 impulsively, and I am doing it as I've done times before, and watching it a second time will show me its flaws better, and yeah it's not a full 8/10 but more like a 7.5 leaning towards 8 and I liked this one more than the first one.Update: Watched it a second time and I think I like it a little less and noticed more problems with it, but I still like it, so I'm changing it to a 7 here.",positif
"Many things do not make sense in this movie.Wanda's intention is so out of place. Even worse, she changes her mind at the end of the movie is awful. Imagine robbing a bank and changes your mind when you see bank staffs crying....Too much focus on Wanda. This makes Dr. Strange and other characters so meaningless in the movie.The first half is the movie set up audience for book of vishanti. Telling the audience how it is so important and unreachable. We didn't get to see book of vishanti being used once... why would Marvel introduce book of vishanti and hype the audience up in the first half of the movie.Poorly written script for america chavez. The entire movie we saw her and Dr. Strange running away from one place to another. She could not control her power her entire life but manage to control after Strange said ""believe in yourself""..... it's 2022 how could this even happen....",positif
Great visuals and acting from the cast but can't say I'm not disappointed. They tried bringing in so many characters to make future movies connect but by doing that the whole thing turned messy.,positif
"This won't be a fan favourite but mixing the marvel cinema experience with a splash of ""old school"" horror hit the target for me.It's weird, but id go as far as saying that a marvel movie was the best horror flick I've seen in over a decade.Dark, creepy and visually epic.The plot was pretty basic, but i had fun watching.I like that they're mixing it up.",positif
"SPOILER WARNING: I'm going to do my best to be as spoiler-free as possible, but I also want people going to see this movie to be, you know, surprised.It seems like the majority of people posting negatively about this movie hit the Venn Diagram just right of those that enjoy negatively posting on holidays as well. Now, I may be one of the most cynical people you'll ever meet, but it turns out that I actually want movies to entertain me. And when they entertain people other than me, I can accept their audience, move on and enjoy the movies that entertain me without dwelling.So yes: this is a superhero movie. It's a blockbuster. It's the 28th movie in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. You also have had to have some cursory knowledge of Wandavision -- there's this great thing called YouTube that has these things called recaps, you know -- and What If? Yet you can enjoy this without that. And yes, this has Sam Raimi coming back to direct a superhero movie.Even more importantly, this is the return of Sam Raimi to movies about cursed books.Doctor Strange director and co-writer Scott Derrickson left over creative differences -- his movie The Black Phone is coming out someday, right? -- and that left Raimi and Michael Waldron (Heels, Loki) to start over.From the original trailers, I was worried that this would cover the same ground as Loki, with Strange being called on the carpet for his abuse of the multiverse. Yet the movie does an early rug pull and places -- there's that spoiler reminder one more time -- Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch -- into the role of big bad.Some backstory: Wanda was born in Eastern Europe, where her parents were killed by a Stark Industries missile, and she and her brother Pietro (Quicksilver) survived and were augmented by Hydra's Baron Wolfgang von Strucker. Working with Ultron, she tried to destroy Stark and the Avengers before learning that the robot's real goal was destroying the human race. This led to her, the Vision (a clone of Ultron turned to the side of good) and the Avengers stopping Ultron and then her joining the team. She and Vision become a couple, join Steve Rogers' side during the Civil War event and then she must destroy Vision to protect the Mind Stone from Thanos, which means nothing, as he uses the Time Stone to undo her and Vision's sacrifice. After a five year-plus battle with Thanos, she and the Avengers win, but her grief at losing Vision causes her to basically abduct the entire town of Westview and create her own sitcom reality -- she learned English as a child from watching American TV -- and raising sons Tommy and Billy with the Vision before her illusion is shattered by Agatha Harkness. The truth is that she's destined to be the Scarlet Witch -- the MCU version of Dark Phoenix, the Harbinger of Chaos more powerful than the Sorcerer Supreme -- at which point Wanda traps Harkness in the town and leaves to study a book called the Darkhold, the Book of the Damned, created by the Elder God Chthon, written in blood on flesh pages (hey Sam Raimi) and bound into book form by Morgan Le Faye, not so coincidentally the villain of the first Dr. Strange movie on TV in 1978, long before the MCU was even a thing.Yet Wanda's quest isn't predicated on evil. She learns that there is more than one reality and that in each of these -- you can glimpse these realities in your dreams -- her children still exist and haven't gone away when the spells she cast at Westview were negated. All she wants is her children, but to get them, she'll destroy entire realities.Meanwhile...take a breath...there's America Chavez (Xochitl Gomez), who was born outside the multiverse and has the power to open doors between worlds. The first use of her powers pushed her parents into another reality and sent her running from the Scarlet Witch, who wants to absorb her power -- killing her -- so that she can find a world with her children and be a mother again.We return to the central MCU reality -- Earth-616 also the same number as the comic universe -- where Dr. Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) is attending the wedding of the love of his life, Christine Palmer (Rachel McAdams) when a giant monster -- which can't legally be called Shuma-Gorath and is called Gargantos -- attempts to take America, who is saved by Strange and Sorcerer Supreme Wong (Benedict Wong). Of course, our hero has no idea that Wanda is the Scarlet Witch, but soon figures it out. The entire magical training world of Kamar-Taj attempts to protect America, who must escape with Strange through the multiverse.And that's where I really feel like the spoilers would be too much, right?So let's just discuss the merits of the film.I can't lie. I walked out of the movie with a huge smile on my face, but any film that combines the bull alien Rintrah and a cameo of the Living Tribunal with the look and feel of a Raimi film -- multiple dissolves of faces and objects like a comic book panel, wild POV shots, heroes getting slapped repeatedly and comedy mixed in with horror. Now, it's not full-on Evil Dead, despite the idea that this is the scariest MCU movie ever. I've seen a lot of folks upset about that, but what did you expect? Did Raimi make the Spider-Man films gore-filled epics?I also do like the idea that Dr. Strange continues to evolve from the self-possessed braggart he started as and the man who said to Spider-Man ""In the grand calculus of the multiverse, their sacrifice means far more than their deaths."" Whereas in Spider-Man: No Way Home, that line showed that Strange would do anything to protect the multiverse, when Defender Stranger says it in the beginning, it's to prove that Strange believes that he alone can save the say, when by the end, he realizes that he's not the only hero. When he said to Starlord in Avengers: Civil War that there was only one way to win, now he realizes that just as there are so many realities, there can also be so many solutions. He's also learned from each different version of himself -- Defender Strange, Earth-838 Strange and Sinister Strange -- the same one from What If? -- that he must make personal growth in addition to protecting the Earth. I loved the scene where he fixed his watch and bowed to Wong, showing that he understands his place.That's some pretty astounding character growth for a character in a blockbuster.Also, for Raimi fans, the 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 shows up. Bruce Campbell shows up -- twice. Even a Grindhouse Releasing logo shows up. Throughout, I didn't feel like he was compromised. The music fight alone is incredibly inventive, as is how Strange makes his way back to Earth despite being trapped on a ruined world.Perhaps most moving is a line that a certain wheelchair-bound hero says in the film: ""Just because someone stumbles and loses their way, doesn't mean they are lost forever."" That's an important message to understand. So is the fact that America has two mothers, a fact directly from the comic book and presented as such: it's just an ordinary way of life. As for America, her look and powers have emerged directly from the comics and work perfectly within the film, as she shows by the end that she may be smarter than any of the adults locked in this battle.I'd hope that even non-comic fans give this a chance. It's a visual-filled odyssey through worlds of magic and I had so much fun throughout. It did what all good films should: it made me forget life for a fleeting moment -- something needed more than ever -- and gave me joy.You can't ask for more than that, even if you rarely get it.",positif
"This isn't a MCU film, it's a Sam Rami film. I was in cloud 9 especially at the very beginning of the movie with its impressive visuals and intense, insane action. I haven't seen of all MCU but I'm very familiar with their usual formula or story structure. Into the Multiverse of Madness takes a more refreshing approach with a lot of brutality, felt pre-Disney era, and the humor felt right. Rami managed to added in some of his horror elements in there (Drag Me to Hell vibes) but I wanted more but I digress. The ""short"" runtime doesn't feel short, it's evenly paced out with no rushed moments (I recommend watching or rewatching WandaVision prior). Obviously, Cumberbatch and especially Olsen stole the show with their masterly performances. And last but not least, the amazing, Sam Rami god I miss him and his unique but amazing craft. Appreciate the movie for what it is and not with your expectations.",positif
"Whatever your thoughts are about Marvel you have to give them credit for their worldbuilding and character development. Wanda and Dr. Strange are both very unique and gray characters which makes them fun. The actors also do a great job portraying their characters.Marvel has never been this dark before. I'm honestly surprised it hasn't got a higher age limit. But it's great with darker content. Marvel has for a long time felt too childish but this feels more real and got a stronger effect.The multiverse is a very confusing subject and it can ruin movies, but it can also make them more fun. This movie did a good job not making it too confusing while also utilizing it and creating fun fanservice.Like the previous Doctor Strange movie, the visual effects are spectacular and breathtaking. There are some scenes which are not quite as believable but it doesn't take the viewer out of the movie.The problem with these powerful magic characters is that they are too overpowered. There's a lot of plot armor, but it's almost impossible to avoid when you're playing with these powerful heroes. The magic can be a bit convoluted at times, but just remind yourself that it's a movie. Don't try poke holes at every plothole or stupid decision. Just have fun because it's a fun movie.",positif
"Doctor strange and the multiverse of madness is a good film don't get me wrong. But it didn't have enough multiverse. The film had a couple of more horror styled moments in it. I also feel it didn't have enough strange for a doctor strange movie.This film had only a couple of multiverses they actually went into. But most multiverses that you see are when America charves opens a star portal and doctor strange go's through with her. There are only 2 and a half multiverses that they actually spend time in. So for a multiverse film, they should have had more multiverse in it.But the rest of the film was good. I do feel that strange should have had a bit more on screen time. Wanda actually had more onscreen time then doctor strange. But any way i still think this was a good film and i can't wait to see what happens with doctor strange.",positif
"Actually, I expected many things in the movie before it was released plus all the spots and trailers that hyped me so much. This movie has every Raimi's style, such as, great camera angles, editing, and color grading also the terrifying tone from every Raimi movie. Besides the great things in this movie, it carries bunch of wired dialogues and screenplay. There are lots of plot holes in this movie. In this movie, there are many elements that can be use in the further movies, but they just...like throw it in some bad ways I never understand. So as a MCU fan, this just make me disappointed so much. As I say without Raimi directing style, this will be even worse than this.",positif
"Movie review: - Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness without final burning + online download link Pros: - - The visual effects are in the best effects in the Marvel Cinematic Universe - Elizabeth Olsen, Benedict Cumberbatch and America Chavez, excellent epic representation - The soundtrack is very enjoyable And your entry into the film mode - the action is very excellent and executed logically The negatives: - - the story is very bad, poor and superficial - the plot is ugly - the transfers from one scene to another show that the movie was modified by the studio It appeared, God is good, but its use is illogically wrong - unfortunately, Marvel Curve is gradually decreasing in a sad way - the scene that I refuse to because the film is not necessary and there is no need if it was removed, it would not affect - a lot of talk is spread on the release of the EXTENDED version of the movie in the month of 6 in the digital version, and this refers to me My final rating for this movie is 7/10 . Disney's Greed.",positif
"The main story, being quite absurd and ordinary, focuses so much on Wanda and America that Dr. Strange ""strangely"" gets sandwiched in between them. It almost feels you are watching a Wanda film rather than a Dr. Strange film. This was a huge negative as he leaves barely any impact. Majority of the impact is left by Wanda only who puts up a near Civil war like situation with Strange.This is a VFX heavy film. Lots and lots and lots of special effects like any other Marvel film but here, to mask the poor story has been used. It is only this that make the film enjoyable. Often certain fight sequences also make the film enjoyable. Humor also works wherever present.Overall, watch only if you are a die hard follower of marvel series (both films amd web series). If not, then Requesting not to watch just due to peer pressure as many things will go above your head and you will only end up enjoying the vfx nothing else.",positif
